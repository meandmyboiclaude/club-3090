# `docs/` — Documentation Map

This folder holds extended documentation that doesn't belong in the top-level READMEs.

## Operator reference pages

|---|---|
| [`SELF_TEST.md`](SELF_TEST.md) | `genesis self-test` — structural sanity check after `git pull` / pin bump |
| [`BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`](BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md) | `genesis bench` methodology and reproduction recipes |
| [`PLUGINS.md`](PLUGINS.md) | Authoring and shipping a community plugin patch |

## Subdirectories

| Folder | What's inside |
|---|---|
| `_internal/sprint_reports/` (gitignored) | Time-stamped engineering sprint reports (Russian) — internal-only per memory rule `feedback_no_internal_docs_in_public`. Local on Sander's machine; not shipped publicly. |
| [`reference/`](reference/) | Long-form technical references (memory architecture, bot setup, etc.). Stable docs that don't get updated per-sprint. |
