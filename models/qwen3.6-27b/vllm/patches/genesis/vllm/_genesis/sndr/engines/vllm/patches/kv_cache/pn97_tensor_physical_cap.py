"""PN97 — physical-cap on KV cache tensor allocation (Phase 7 PoC).

Architectural goal: decouple `tensor.shape[0]` (physical GPU slots) from
`pool.num_gpu_blocks` (logical addressable block IDs). This is the
missing Anchor #10 documented in Phase 5 design notes.

Without this patch, GENESIS_PN95_VIRT_ENABLE=1 causes CUDA OOM:
the pool inflates to logical=236 blocks → tensor allocation tries
236*per_block_bytes ≈ 84 GiB on a 24 GiB card → torch.OutOfMemoryError.

PN97 wraps `_allocate_kv_cache_tensors` so each KVCacheTensor.size is
capped to `available_memory * factor` (physical GPU only). Subsequent
attention forward reads against logical block_ids > physical_num_blocks
are out of scope here — that needs PN98 (block_id translation table in
attention kernel surface).

PN97 ALONE does NOT unlock 156K single-user. It is a prerequisite that
prevents the OOM crash when VIRT_ENABLE is set; the actual long-context
support requires the full PN95 demote/promote cycle to keep only the
attention-relevant blocks GPU-resident — coordinated with attention
forward through PN98 (future work).

Env gate: `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN97_TENSOR_PHYSICAL_CAP=1` (default OFF).

Anchor: vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py::_allocate_kv_cache_tensors
on the `for kv_cache_tensor in kv_cache_config.kv_cache_tensors:` line.
