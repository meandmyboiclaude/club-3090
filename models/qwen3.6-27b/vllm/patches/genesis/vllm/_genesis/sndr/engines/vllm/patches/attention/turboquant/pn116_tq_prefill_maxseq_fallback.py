"""Wiring for Patch PN116 — TurboQuant prefill `max_seq_len` fallback fix.

Genesis-original — fixes an unintended regression introduced by
[vllm#41434](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41434)
([Perf][3/n] Eliminate GPU<->CPU syncs in attention impls,
merged 2026-05-08).

================================================================
WHAT THIS PATCH DOES
================================================================

`vllm#41434` reworked
``TurboQuantImpl.forward → _prefill_attention`` to replace a
``max(seq_lens[num_decodes:].tolist())`` GPU→CPU sync with a CPU-
resident metadata lookup. The intent is good and on **Hopper GB200**
the PR measured +4.8 % output throughput. The shape of the fast path
is::

    if attn_metadata.seq_lens_cpu is not None:
        prefill_max_seq = int(attn_metadata.seq_lens_cpu[num_decodes:].max())
    else:
        prefill_max_seq = attn_metadata.max_seq_len

The problem is the **else** branch. ``attn_metadata.max_seq_len`` is
the **full-batch max** — it includes the decode requests. The PR's
own comment notes ‘decode requests inflate max_seq_len’ and this is
exactly why ``_prefill_attention`` previously computed the max over
the prefill slice only. When ``seq_lens_cpu`` is None (some edge of
the V1 builder path, or any caller that constructs metadata directly
without populating the CPU mirror), the fallback feeds the attention
kernel an **inflated upper bound** that forces it to size all
buffers for the wrong shape and run extra work per layer.

On our Wave 8 2× A5000 35B-A3B-FP8 + TurboQuant + MTP K=3 path the
measured effect is **−9.7 % wall_TPS** (241.35 → 217.96 between
dev93 and dev209+). 27B INT4 + GDN is **unaffected** (parity
maintained, 132.28 → 132.23). The asymmetry is consistent with
35B-A3B's mixed prefill/decode batches hitting the fallback more
often (MoE dispatch shapes vary; the cam upper-bound mirror is
absent on enough steps to dominate).

The fix is exactly what the original code did: compute the prefill-
slice max correctly. We **preserve the fast path** when
``seq_lens_cpu`` is populated (most paths post-#41434 do populate
it; the PR's win on Hopper still applies) and we **replace the
inflated fallback** with the original ``.tolist()`` max. The
fallback sync is single-stream, blocks the CPU for ~µs, and is
**only paid when the fast path is unavailable** — exactly the cost
the original code had. This is "do no harm" — same-or-better than
the pre-#41434 baseline on every call.

================================================================
ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED
================================================================

- **Patch the builder to always populate ``seq_lens_cpu``.** Cleaner
  in principle but the builder is shared and the V1 wiring assumes
  callers may omit the field. Touching the builder risks side-
  effects on other backends; the targeted fix here is contained.

- **Disable #41434 entirely (env flag).** Loses the +4.8 % win on
  paths where it works. We want the optimisation, just not the
  fallback bug.

- **Wait for upstream fix.** No upstream issue filed yet for this
  fallback specifically. Genesis ships the fix immediately and
  the patch self-retires when upstream changes the fallback (we
  watch for absence of the `attn_metadata.max_seq_len` literal in
  the fallback branch).

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- Behaviour-preserving when `seq_lens_cpu` is populated (fast path
  unchanged).
- Behaviour-preserving when caller previously hit the
  `.tolist()` sync path on the pre-#41434 code shape (we reinstate
  that exact computation).
- Idempotent via Genesis marker.
- Drift-marker watches for upstream removing the buggy fallback
  (e.g. a follow-up PR that always populates `seq_lens_cpu` or
  re-derives the max some other way).
