"""Wiring for Patch N12 — FFN intermediate scratch pool (Cliff 1 fix on TQ3).

================================================================
WHAT IT FIXES
================================================================

Empirical OOM noonghunna reproduced on RTX 3090 + Lorbus 27B + 192K
context + tool call:

    torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory.
    Tried to allocate 138.00 MiB. GPU 0 has 122.56 MiB free.

Root cause located: `vllm/model_executor/layers/activation.py:146`
SiluAndMul.forward_cuda allocates a fresh `[M, intermediate_size]` BF16
tensor PER LAYER PER STEP:

    out = torch.empty(output_shape, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)

For Lorbus Qwen3.6-27B-int4 (intermediate=17408, num_hidden_layers=64)
that's 73-285 MiB transient per layer × 64 layers = **4.7-18 GiB
allocator churn per forward step**. The 138 MiB OOM size class matches
silu_and_mul-out at M ≈ 4096 BF16 exactly.

PN8 closes Cliff 1 on FP8 by freeing ~600 MiB persistent draft VRAM,
giving the heap enough slack for the 138 MiB transient. On TQ3 PN8
only frees ~230 MiB → not enough → OOM still fires. **Different
memory class — persistent footprint vs transient peak.**

================================================================
WHAT THIS PATCH DOES
================================================================

Text-patch `SiluAndMul.forward_cuda` (and 4 sibling activation classes
that share the same memory pattern) so they call into a shared
`FFNIntermediateCache` pool instead of `torch.empty()`.

The pool is **one buffer per (intermediate_size, dtype, device)** —
allocated lazily at first call, sized at the requested num_tokens.
Subsequent calls return a slice; pointer is stable (cudagraph-safe).
On growth (num_tokens exceeds cached max) the buffer is re-allocated
once.

Compatibility classes patched (all share identical forward_cuda body):
- SiluAndMul
- MulAndSilu
- SiluAndMulWithClamp
- FatreluAndMul
- GeluAndMul

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- **Default OFF** (opt-in via `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN12_FFN_INTERMEDIATE_POOL=1`).
- Pure text-patch with idempotent marker.
- Drift-aware: if upstream lands `silu_and_mul.out(input, *, out=out)`
  variant (vllm#34207) the anchor body changes and our marker self-retires.
- Anchor missing → SKIPPED, source stays vanilla, zero regression risk.
- Worst case if PN12 silently misbehaves: pool buffer not zeroed between
  layers means stale data could leak into output. **Mitigated** by the
  fact that `silu_and_mul` op writes the FULL output region in-place
  (every `[M, intermediate_size]` element overwritten by the kernel),
  so no read-of-stale path exists.

================================================================
EXPECTED IMPACT
================================================================

- Closes Cliff 1 (138 MiB OOM at 192K + tool-call) on TQ3 path that
  PN8 couldn't address.
- Reduces per-step allocator churn from ~4.7-18 GiB to ~73-285 MiB
  (the size of the single pooled buffer) on Lorbus 27B-int4.
- Enables longer ctx + concurrent tool-call workloads on 24 GB
  single-card setups.
- Side-effect on FP8 path (35B): same memory-pooling logic applies;
  expect free ~30-50 MiB of allocator overhead at 1K context decode.

    """Idempotent registry hook — exposes POOL_FFN_INTERMEDIATE_SCRATCH
    in PersistentBufferRegistry for operator visibility. No allocation,
    no behavior change.

    The real FFN intermediate scratch tensors are owned by the
    FFNIntermediateCache pool inside vLLM's patched SiluAndMul module.
    Its allocation pattern is GROW-IN-PLACE + SLICE-ON-ACQUIRE (allocate
    `[max_num_tokens, intermediate_size]` once, return slice views for
    smaller requests, grow once on larger requests) — matches
    PersistentSlicePool with key_dims=1.

    v11.3.0 bug fix: this was previously calling `get_pool()` which
    creates a BufferPool. When FFNIntermediateCache.acquire_silu_out
    then calls `_get_backing_pool()` (via `get_slice_pool()`), the
    registry would raise ValueError "pool was registered as BufferPool,
    not PersistentSlicePool". This caused the FFN cache to never engage
    on operators who imported the integration module before the storage
    class — silently falling back to the upstream allocate-per-step
    behaviour the patch was supposed to fix.
