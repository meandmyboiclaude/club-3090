"""G4_26 — backport the TP-correctness half of OPEN vllm PR #45774.

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired, capped <0.23.1rc1.dev672):
superseded by vllm#46177 (MERGED 2026-06-26, merge commit 701a23d99),
which added native DiffusionGemma TP support via a DIFFERENT approach
(local-shard soft-embed + torch.ops.vllm.all_reduce; sampler sc_vocab_
start/end) — deep-diff outcome (c) supersession. Anchor byte-verified
GONE in dev672/dev714/dev748. Do NOT re-vendor (the OPEN mega-PR
#47462 rewrites this territory again — see upstream_watchlist).

================================================================
PURPOSE
================================================================

``DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion`` self-conditioning computes the soft
embedding as ``probs @ embed_weight`` where ``probs`` spans the FULL vocab
(262144 on Gemma-4 diffusion checkpoints). Under tensor parallelism the
``embed_tokens.weight`` of a ``VocabParallelEmbedding`` is vocab-sharded —
at TP=2 it is ``[131072, 2816]``. Feeding that sharded weight directly into
the full-vocab matmul raises:

    RuntimeError: a and b must have same reduction dim, but got
                  [..., 262144] X [131072, 2816]

PR #45774 ("Fix DiffusionGemma for TP>1") fixes this by materializing the
full (unsharded) embedding weight via an all-gather before the matmul. This
patch backports ONLY the three TP-correctness hunks:

  1. import ``get_tensor_model_parallel_world_size`` +
     ``tensor_model_parallel_all_gather`` from ``vllm.distributed``;
  2. add the module-level ``_get_full_embed_weight`` helper (all-gathers the
     sharded weight under TP, returns ``.weight`` unchanged at TP=1);
  3. swap the ``custom_sampler`` call site from
     ``embed_weight=self.model.model.embed_tokens.weight`` to
     ``embed_weight=_get_full_embed_weight(self.model.model.embed_tokens)``.

It deliberately SKIPS the XPU/UVA hunks of #45774 (the
``current_platform.is_xpu()``-guarded ``_build_output``/``__call__`` async
copy paths) — those are Intel-GPU-only and irrelevant on our 2× A5000 rig.
``compute_self_conditioning`` (a dead def-only site) is left untouched.

================================================================
INTEGRATION STRATEGY
================================================================

A ``TextPatcher`` over ``model_executor/models/diffusion_gemma.py`` with 3
ordered sub-patches, each anchored on a byte-faithful region of the live
dev491 module:

  * Sub-1 (import-add): inserts the ``vllm.distributed`` import block between
    the ``CUDAGraphMode`` and ``init_logger`` imports — exactly where #45774
    places it.
  * Sub-2 (helper-add): inserts ``_get_full_embed_weight`` between the
    ``_NO_PENALTIES_STATE`` assignment and the ``class DiffusionSampler``
    definition, preserving PEP8 two-blank-line spacing. ``nn`` and ``torch``
    are already module-level imports on dev491, so the helper's
    ``nn.Module`` / ``torch.Tensor`` annotations resolve without new imports.
  * Sub-3 (line-853-swap): replaces the bare sharded-weight argument with the
    gathered-helper call, anchored on its surrounding 12-space-indented
    context (``confidence_threshold`` above + ``normalizer`` below) for
    in-file uniqueness.

The patcher's ``upstream_drift_markers`` contains ``def _get_full_embed_weight``
so it self-skips once #45774 merges (the upstream file then already defines
the helper).

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

* default_on: False (opt-in correctness fix; only Gemma-4 diffusion
  checkpoints at TP>1 need it).
* env_flag: GENESIS_ENABLE_G4_26_DIFFUSIONGEMMA_TP_VOCAB
* arch-gate: apply() probes the live ``diffusion_gemma`` module for
  ``DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion`` and skips if absent (the arch is NOT in
  ``_gemma4_detect.GEMMA4_ARCHITECTURES``, so a direct presence check is used
  rather than ``is_gemma4_arch``).
* intrinsically TP-gated: the all-gather helper returns ``.weight`` unchanged
  at TP=1, so applying the patch on a single-GPU run is a no-op at runtime.
* applies_to: arch DiffusionGemmaForBlockDiffusion;
  vllm_version_range (">=0.22.1rc1.dev491", "<1.0.0").
* conflicts_with: none. composes_with: none.
