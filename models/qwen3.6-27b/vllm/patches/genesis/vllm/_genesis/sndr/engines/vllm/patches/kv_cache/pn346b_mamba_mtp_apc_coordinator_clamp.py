"""PN346B — coordinator-half clamp (vendor of OPEN PR vllm#45614).

The COORDINATOR half of the SAME fix whose MANAGER half is PN346
==============================================================

Upstream PR vllm#45614 ("[Bugfix][Core] Fix Mamba prefix cache EAGLE
hit", closes vllm#43559) ships TWO halves that together fix the hybrid
Mamba + EAGLE/MTP + ``--enable-prefix-caching`` prefix-cache poison on
our exact PROD shape (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B FP8, MTP K=3, prefix caching on):

  * MANAGER half — ``single_type_kv_cache_manager.py``: walk the
    ``MambaManager`` search boundary back by one block on the EAGLE/MTP
    path so the partially-accepted final SSM state block is never
    matched. **Genesis already vendors this as PN346.**

  * COORDINATOR half — ``v1/core/kv_cache_coordinator.py`` (THIS patch):
    clamp ``curr_hit_length`` so it is **monotonically non-increasing**
    across ``HybridKVCacheCoordinator.find_longest_cache_hit``'s
    fixed-point iteration. **Genesis was MISSING this half.**

Genesis shipped only the manager half (PN346). The coordinator clamp
is the missing sibling — without it, the fixed-point loop can re-grow
``curr_hit_length`` on a verify pass and re-admit the very state block
PN346 walked back, partially defeating the manager-half guard. The two
halves MUST compose and ship together (registry ``composes_with``
cross-references PN346 ⇄ PN346B).

Root cause — the eagle-drop branch can GROW curr_hit_length
=========================================================

Inside ``HybridKVCacheCoordinator.find_longest_cache_hit`` (a while/for
fixed-point loop) each group computes::

    _new_hit_length = len(hit_blocks[0]) * spec.block_size
    if drop_eagle_block:                  # (dev491) / `if use_eagle:` (PROD)
        eagle_verified.add(idx)
    elif _new_hit_length < curr_hit_length:
        # length shrunk; invalidate previous eagle verifications
        eagle_verified.clear()
    curr_hit_length = _new_hit_length     # <-- BUG: naked assignment

The naked assignment unconditionally overwrites ``curr_hit_length``
with ``_new_hit_length``. On the eagle-drop branch ``_new_hit_length``
can be LONGER than the current candidate; the assignment then GROWS
``curr_hit_length`` on a verify pass and re-admits the partially-
accepted final state block — the exact poison PN346 fixes in the
manager. The fix clamps so the value can only stay or shrink::

    curr_hit_length = min(curr_hit_length, _new_hit_length)

This matches the manager-half guard's intent: the hit length is
monotonically non-increasing across the fixed-point iteration.

Pin-agnostic anchor (resolves byte-identically on dev491 AND PROD)
=================================================================

The line IMMEDIATELY ABOVE the clamp diverges by pin:

  * dev491 (0.22.1rc1.dev491+g1033ffac2): ``if drop_eagle_block:``
    (loop unpacks ``(spec, group_ids, manager_cls, use_eagle)``;
    local ``drop_eagle_block = use_eagle and idx not in eagle_verified``).
  * PROD   (0.21.1rc0+g626fa9bba):        ``if use_eagle:``
    (loop unpacks ``(spec, group_ids, manager_cls)``;
    local ``use_eagle = idx in self.eagle_attn_group_indices and
    idx not in eagle_verified``).

So the anchor DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES that ``if ...:`` line. The 4-line
anchor (``elif _new_hit_length < curr_hit_length:`` →
``curr_hit_length = _new_hit_length``) is byte-identical AND
grep-unique (count==1) on BOTH pins. Verified: ``min(curr_hit_length``
is absent on the live dev491 container AND the PROD image → the clamp
is genuinely missing on both.

Why we vendor this OPEN PR (not just wait for upstream merge)
=============================================================

  * It is the missing half of a correctness fix Genesis ALREADY ships
    default-ON (PN346). A half-fix is worse than none: the manager
    guard can be partially undone by the unclamped coordinator re-grow.
  * The fix is a ONE-LINE ``min()`` clamp — surgical, no perf cost on
    the non-EAGLE path, no signature change, no caller change.
  * Same upstream issue (#43559), same PR (#45614) as PN346 — they are
    a unit. Composition + default-ON parity guarantee both land
    together on every boot.

Part-B defensive belt (vendor of vllm#46281 Part B)
===================================================

A SECOND, ``required=False`` sub-patch folds in the Mamba-group
post-loop truncation from the THIRD independent upstream attempt at the
same #43559 poison (PR vllm#46281). After the fixed-point loop,
``find_longest_cache_hit`` already truncates the FULL-ATTENTION group's
hit-block list to the final ``hit_length``; the belt mirrors that for
the Mamba group on a simple hybrid (``FullAttentionManager`` drops its
last hit block on the EAGLE look-ahead path but ``MambaManager`` does
not, so the two block lists can be left misaligned). It is LATENT on
PROD (APC OFF on our hybrid 27B/35B) and largely redundant given PN346's
manager-half walk-back, but survives the thin window where PN346's
manager anchor drift-skips while PN346B still applies. Guarded on
``is_simple_hybrid and len(attention_groups) > 1 and
isinstance(attention_groups[1].spec, MambaSpec)`` (edge-case hardening
over the PR's bare index assumption) so it is a strict no-op on any
non-simple-hybrid / non-Mamba topology. ``required=False`` so a missing
FA-truncation anchor (future refactor) soft-skips and the load-bearing
Part-A clamp still lands. No new patch id — the belt rides PN346B's
existing env flag, lifecycle, and version range (design t1 §4).

Composition + safety
====================

  * Targets ``v1/core/kv_cache_coordinator.py`` — a DIFFERENT file than
    PN346 (``single_type_kv_cache_manager.py``). Zero anchor overlap;
    the two coexist by construction.
  * No P85-style anchor overlap exists on the coordinator file, so
    PN346B needs no dual-anchor variants.
  * Opt-out-only (default-ON), mirroring PN346: honors
    ``GENESIS_DISABLE_PN346B``, ignores ``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN346B``.
  * Self-skips once #45614 merges upstream via the drift marker
    ``curr_hit_length = min(curr_hit_length, _new_hit_length)`` (the
    exact merged shape) → idempotent / skip, file untouched.

Upstream regression test (lives in the vLLM tree, not Genesis):
``test_hybrid_mamba_eagle_does_not_reuse_lookahead_state`` in
``tests/v1/core/test_prefix_caching.py`` (carried by PR #45614).

Risk: LOW — one-line ``min()`` clamp, only narrows the hit length.
Effort: XS.

# ── Part-B belt: Mamba-group post-loop truncation (vllm#46281 Part B) ─
#
# PR vllm#46281 ("Align hybrid model prefix-cache hit lengths …") is a
# THIRD, independent upstream attempt at the same #43559 poison. Its
# Part A (curr_hit_length min() clamp) is byte-identical to what PN346B
# already ships above, so it adds nothing. Its Part B is a DIFFERENT
# site: after the fixed-point loop, mirror the existing full-attention
# block truncation for the Mamba group so the Mamba hit-block list is
# also trimmed to the final hit_length (FullAttentionManager drops its
# last hit block on the EAGLE look-ahead path but MambaManager does not,
# so without the mirror the two block lists can be left misaligned).
#
# We fold ONLY Part B into PN346B as a required=False DEFENSIVE BELT
# (design t1 §4). It is latent on PROD (APC is OFF for our hybrid 27B/35B)
# and largely redundant given PN346's manager-half walk-back, which makes
# the final-state block never *considered*. It survives the thin window
# where PN346's manager anchor drift-skips on a future pin but PN346B
# still applies — in that window the post-loop Mamba trim is the only
# thing left trimming the Mamba list.
#
# Anchor: the post-loop full-attention truncation block (byte-identical
# and grep-unique on dev424). Replacement: append a Mamba-group mirror.
#
# Edge-case hardening over the raw PR (iron-rule #10): the PR's Part B
# assumes attention_groups[1] exists and is the Mamba spec. We guard on
# is_simple_hybrid (the loop-local already computed above) AND
# len(self.attention_groups) > 1 AND isinstance(...[1].spec, MambaSpec)
# so the belt is a strict no-op on any non-simple-hybrid / non-Mamba
# topology rather than an IndexError. required=False so a missing
