"""Phase 2 — per-pin anchor manifest generator + true-drift classifier (R2).

Given the discovery (anchor_discovery.iter_anchor_targets) and a PRISTINE vLLM
source tree for a target pin, classify every anchor against the REAL source
(no heuristics — real string search via the proven compute_anchor_meta) and
build ``pins/<pin>/anchors.json`` for the ``ok`` set plus a ``.rej`` list of
the genuinely-drifted anchors that need a human re-anchor.

R2: drift is decided from the actual pristine source text, never assumed. A
patch is ``ok`` iff its anchor is present EXACTLY ONCE (compute_anchor_meta
returns a meta); ``anchor_drift`` iff absent; ``ambiguous`` iff >1 or
non-ASCII surroundings (manifest can't address it safely).

Source reading is injected (``read_source(target_rel) -> str | None``) so the
classifier is unit-testable on synthetic fixtures locally and runs against the
live pristine tree on the rig.

Implements Phase 2 of the per-pin anchor source-of-truth design.
