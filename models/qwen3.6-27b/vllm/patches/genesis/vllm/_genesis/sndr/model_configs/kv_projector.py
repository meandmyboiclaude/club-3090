"""Byte-level KV / VRAM projector — "given THIS ctx / kv-format / max-num-seqs /
tp, what's my ACTUAL per-card GB and will it OOM?".

This is the Genesis analogue of club-3090's ``tools/kv-calc.py`` (the math
STRUCTURE is borrowed — per-card weights + growing-KV pool + recurrent state +
activation peak + cudagraph overhead + drafter, with the vLLM "KV pool fills the
budget" capping behavior, a PASS/TIGHT/FAIL verdict, and the ``--fit-all`` whole-
catalog projection mode). The per-family calibration coefficients are OUR OWN,
derived from OUR measured reality on 2× A5000 24 GB, vLLM pin dev424 — NOT copied
from club-3090.

Paper anchors (provenance for the byte-level model)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
- **PagedAttention** (Kwon et al., arXiv:2309.06180) — the block-paged KV pool
  fills ``mem_util × VRAM`` minus the fixed footprint; the requested pool being
  *capped* (not refused) is the TIGHT verdict's basis.
- **PerfMamba** (arXiv:2511.22849) — the GDN/Mamba block-state activation peak is
  O(γ·D·N·L), linear in context; the ``_ACTIVATION_COEF_BYTES`` term follows this
  form (calibrated, not guessed — see the 35B PN403 anchor below).
- **TurboQuant** (arXiv:2504.19874) — the asymmetric k8v4 KV cache (8-bit K +
  4-bit V → 0.75 B/element) the 35B/27B production lanes run; sets ``bpe`` for the
  ``turboquant_k8v4`` formats in ``KV_FORMAT_BYTES``.

Why this module exists
──────────────────────
``preflight_fit.py`` answers the ENVELOPE question ("does my rig clear the
declared min-VRAM floor + SM + GPU count?"). It does NOT answer the BYTE-LEVEL
question. Before this module, Genesis had zero byte-level fit math: no
``kv_pool_per_card`` / ``solve_max_ctx`` / ``project`` anywhere. ``kv_calc.py``
(the tool) and ``memory_estimator.py`` read ``config.json`` + safetensors from
DISK — they are I/O-bound and can't run from a typed preset alone. This module
is PURE and I/O-free: it drives entirely off the ``ModelShape`` dims declared on
the preset (``capabilities.shape`` in schema_v2) plus the rig VRAM, so the GUI /
CLI can project a fit before anything touches the host.

The math (per card, after TP split)
────────────────────────────────────
    total_gb = weights_gb               # resident weights ÷ TP
             + kv_pool_gb              # growing KV pool (attention layers only)
             + recurrent_state_gb      # GDN/Mamba fixed state (hybrid models)
             + activation_gb           # prefill activation peak (ctx-linear)
             + cudagraph_overhead_gb   # capture + workspace
             + drafter_gb              # MTP / DFlash adder

vLLM sizes the KV pool to fill ``mem_util × VRAM`` minus the fixed components,
so when the *requested* pool (max_ctx × max_num_seqs) exceeds the available
slack the verdict is TIGHT (vLLM caps the pool — effective concurrency drops),
not FAIL. FAIL is reserved for "the fixed footprint alone leaves no room for
even one max_ctx sequence" (a real refuse-to-boot).

Calibration (see docs/KV_PROJECTOR.md for the full derivation)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- **35B-A3B FP8 TQ-k8v4 — CALIBRATED (strong anchor).** The dev424 PN403
  investigation captured LIVE engine telemetry at max-model-len=280000, TP=2,
  k8v4, mem-util=0.9: ``kv_cache_size_tokens=388620``, ``num_gpu_blocks=161``.
  The 10-full-attention × 2-KV-head × 128-head_dim × k8v4 per-token formula
  reproduces a 388,672-token pool capacity = 0.01% off the live 388,620. The
  fixed-footprint coefficients (activation, recurrent, overhead, MTP) are tuned
  so the projector's available-for-KV at that operating point matches the live
  pool within ~1%.
- **27B int4 AutoRound TQ-k8v4 — PROVISIONAL.** No captured ``num_gpu_blocks``
  anchor exists; only the docs/HARDWARE.md residency table + context formula.
  ``project()`` flags this model's ``Projection.provisional=True`` so callers
  surface the lower confidence honestly. The framework is identical; only the
  confidence label differs.

    that yields a SKIP row with a note, so one bad entry can't kill the table.

        cards: iterable of per-card VRAM sizes in GiB (e.g. ``(24, 48, 80)``).
