"""PN347 — vendor of OPEN PR vllm#44113 (shernshiou) MarlinFP8 N==K correctness.

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired, cap kept <0.22.1rc1.dev491): superseded
by vllm#44735's structural size_k_first caller-contract refactor at dev491+,
which DELETED the buggy ``w_q.shape != (...)`` transpose guard (anchor GONE on
pristine dev748). Both live pins are >> dev491 so PN347 is inert; still applies
on a <dev491 rollback pin where the old guard exists.

MarlinFP8 weight transpose silently skipped for square (N==K) matrices on sm_75-88
=================================================================================

The bug (and why it is a CORRECTNESS, not a perf, regression)
-------------------------------------------------------------

vLLM PR #38092 added this shape-tuple guard in
``MarlinFP8ScaledMMLinearKernel.process_weights_after_loading``::

    if w_q.shape != (
        layer.input_size_per_partition,
        layer.output_size_per_partition,
    ):
        replace_parameter(layer, "weight", w_q.t())

Intent: skip the transpose when the caller already pre-transposed to ``(K, N)``
(modelopt path); apply the transpose when the caller hands ``(N, K)`` from a
checkpoint (CompressedTensorsW8A16Fp8 / Fp8LinearMethod use_marlin branch).

The bug: for a **square** weight (``N == K``), the tuples ``(N, K)`` and
``(K, N)`` are IDENTICAL — the guard always evaluates ``False`` and the
transpose is silently skipped, regardless of the actual memory layout.
Marlin then multiplies a wrongly-laid-out weight tensor → silent data
corruption in the affected layers' outputs. NO exception, NO log, NO check.
The kernel returns garbage that LOOKS like a valid activation.

Concrete blast radius on our hardware
-------------------------------------

We run 2× RTX A5000 (sm_86 Ampere). MarlinFP8 fires on sm_75-88 (we lack
native FP8 compute → Marlin INT4-style packed kernels emulate). Our
Qwen3.6 27B INT4 and 35B FP8 models both contain square Linear weights in
attention:

  * Qwen3.6 27B: hidden=4096 → q_proj 4096×4096, k_proj/v_proj 4096×4096,
    o_proj 4096×4096 — all square.
  * Qwen3.6 35B FP8: hidden=5120 → q_proj 5120×5120, o_proj 5120×5120 —
    square.

All of these layers, when loaded through the CompressedTensorsW8A16Fp8 or
Fp8LinearMethod use_marlin branch, hand a ``(N, K)`` contiguous tensor
into ``process_weights_after_loading``. Pre-fix, the buggy guard treats
``(N, K)`` and ``(K, N)`` as equal → no transpose → Marlin reads the
weight in the wrong layout.

Upstream test result on A40 (sm_86, identical layout to our A5000)::

    BF16: The capital of France is Paris...
    FP8:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,                  ← total token-stream
                                                  collapse on square layers

The exact fix
-------------

Switch from a (broken) shape-tuple compare to a (correct) memory-layout
check: a contiguous tensor is in checkpoint ``(N, K)`` layout and needs
transpose; a non-contiguous tensor is a ``.t()`` view in ``(K, N)``
layout and must NOT be transposed again::

    if w_q.is_contiguous():
        replace_parameter(layer, "weight", w_q.t())

The contiguity flag is robust to square shapes because PyTorch's ``.t()``
on a 2-D tensor returns a non-contiguous view (strides swapped) — even
when shape happens to be symmetric.

Why we vendor an OPEN PR
------------------------

* The PR is OPEN as of 2026-06-09; merge ETA unknown.
* The fix is one method, six lines net, behaviour-preserving on the
  non-buggy path (non-square layers already worked; the new check still
  routes them correctly through the contiguous branch).
* The corruption is silent — we cannot wait. Quality-bench delta on
  square attention layers is unknown without applying the fix.

ROI / risk
----------

ROI: correctness restoration on every square Linear layer in attention
projections (q/k/v/o) of Qwen3.6 27B and 35B on A5000. Expected:
measurable improvement on any quality bench (perplexity, MMLU, tool-call
correctness) currently bottlenecked by hidden FP8 attention corruption.

Risk: LOW. Behaviour preserved on:
  * non-square layers (was-contiguous branch still transposes)
  * modelopt pre-transposed input (was-non-contiguous branch still
    no-ops); modelopt itself is touched by the upstream PR with the same
    semantics — we only vendor the Marlin-kernel side, not the modelopt
    workaround removal, so callers see no change.
  * sm_89+ (Marlin path not taken; FP8 native compute used instead).
  * block-quant branch (entirely separate ``if self.block_quant`` branch).

Composition
-----------

  * No anchor overlap with any existing Genesis Marlin patch
    (``kernels/p87_marlin_pad_sub_tile.py`` exists but targets the Marlin
    INT4 kernel internals, not the FP8 weight-loading hook).
  * Composes with PN77 (FP8 lm_head — different layer), PN81 (FP8
    block-scaled — different branch), PN91/PN91B (INT4 AutoRound —
    different scheme), P87 (Marlin INT4 sub-tile pad — different kernel).
  * CORRECTNESS category — not perf — quality gain is restoration, not
    improvement.
