"""PN387 — reject degenerate ``structured_outputs`` (vendor of vllm#45346).

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired, capped <0.23.1rc1.dev714): vllm#45346
MERGED 2026-06-30 (merge commit ac521f62) and both guards are byte-identical
NATIVE in the pristine dev714 AND dev748 images (verified via docker-run greps
on the rig, 2026-07-05 — deep-diff outcome (a)). The Layer-2 gateway-edge
guard was defence-in-depth over the same reject; the native validation-time
fix already returns the 400 at the frontend. Kept for reference / pins that
predate the merge.

LAYER 1 of 2 — the SOURCE OVERLAY (verbatim backport of PR #45346).
The companion Layer 2 is the Genesis gateway-edge guard wired in
``sndr/engines/vllm/patches/middleware/edge_guard_reject_degenerate_structured_outputs.py``
(logic in ``sndr/engines/vllm/middleware/reject_degenerate_structured_outputs.py``).
This module is the SINGLE PN387 registry entrypoint: its ``apply()`` drives
BOTH files atomically via ``MultiFilePatchTransaction``.
Both layers are gated on the SAME opt-in flag — see Activation below.

================================================================
UPSTREAM BUG (vllm#45346) — CONFIRMED INSTANCE-WIDE DoS ON OUR PROD
================================================================

A single request with ``structured_outputs={"json_object": false}`` or
``{"json": ""}`` crashes the **EngineCore** process: the request returns
500 ``EngineDeadError`` and every subsequent request fails (instance-wide
DoS — fatal on our single-instance PROD, no second replica to absorb it).

Mechanism: ``StructuredOutputsParams.__post_init__`` counts the
constraint fields with ``is not None``, so ``json_object=False``
(``False is not None`` → True) and ``json=""`` (``"" is not None`` → True)
both pass the mutual-exclusivity check — a ``StructuredOutputRequest`` is
built and dispatched to the engine. But ``get_structured_output_key`` only
returns ``JSON_OBJECT`` when ``json_object`` is *truthy*, so ``False``
falls through to ``raise ValueError("No valid structured output parameter
found")``; an empty ``json`` schema fails inside the xgrammar compiler.
Both ``ValueError``s are raised inside the EngineCore step loop, which has
NO per-request isolation, so one bad request kills the engine for everyone.

================================================================
THE FIX (this layer) — reject during request validation
================================================================

PR #45346 rejects both inputs in
``SamplingParams._validate_structured_outputs`` (called by ``verify()``,
frontend → 400), immediately next to the existing empty-grammar guard
(pristine line 888 in pin ``g303916e93``):

  • ``json`` is an empty string → ``ValueError`` (mirrors the empty-grammar
    guard's ``.strip() == ""`` shape).
  • ``json_object is False`` → ``ValueError`` (``json_object`` is a flag;
    only ``True`` selects a constraint — omit ``structured_outputs`` to
    disable structured outputs).

The bad request now fails fast at the frontend (400) and the engine keeps
serving. The deeper per-request engine-step exception isolation is a
separate, larger change and is intentionally out of scope (per the PR).

================================================================
RELEVANCE FOR GENESIS + WHY THE SECOND (EDGE) LAYER EXISTS
================================================================

Our public surface (Proxy-AI gateway + OpenAI-compatible streaming
clients) accepts user-controlled ``structured_outputs``. On a single PROD
instance, the EngineDeadError takes down ALL four model families at once.
This source overlay closes the crash at request validation. The Genesis
extra (Layer 2) adds a gateway-edge guard at the very top of
``_create_chat_completion`` so the reject becomes a clean 400 at the
gateway edge — BEFORE the request descends into the engine loop — which is
strictly defence-in-depth on top of this validation-time fix.

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

  • The two guards run once per request inside the existing
    ``_validate_structured_outputs`` path — same cost envelope as the
    empty-grammar / empty-choice guards already there (two cheap
    ``isinstance`` / identity checks). Bit-identical for every valid input.
  • A legitimate ``json_object=True`` request is UNAFFECTED — only the
    degenerate ``False`` selector is rejected.
  • Default OFF (``default_on=False``): this is a pure safety reject; the
    gate lets us A/B the rejection criteria (e.g. confirm no real client
    relies on the legacy ``json_object: false`` no-op shape) before
    enabling. STRONG RECOMMENDATION: enable on every single-instance PROD
    — the unguarded path is a one-request kill switch.
  • Drift markers watch the canonical upstream guard strings so the patch
    self-skips when #45346 lands in our pin. Genesis spells its drift
    markers as the upstream form (which never appears in our own emitted
    comment text — we add no new comment that quotes them) so the lint
    self-collision contract (tools/lint_drift_markers.py, PN369) holds.
