"""PN351 — vendor of OPEN PR vllm#43257 (ShuaiShao93) Triton unified_attention tune for head_dim >= 512.

Triton unified attention tile-size + warps + stages tuned for very large head dims
==================================================================================

**Problem**: ``vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_unified_attention.py``
hardcodes ``num_warps=4`` and ``num_stages=3`` in the kernel launch.
For head sizes < 256 this is the sweet spot — high occupancy, good
pipeline coverage. But for head_dim >= 512 (Gemma 4 31B uses 512;
Gemma 4 26B-A4B uses 256 + extra global heads with 512), the kernel
hits a register cliff: per-thread register pressure forces the
backend to spill or cap occupancy. Author bench on Hopper SM 9.0 + FP8:

  * head_dim=512, prefill, FP8 KV — occupancy at default 4w/3s: 6-13 %
  * head_dim=512, prefill, FP8 KV — with 8w/2s + 64-tile: 25-40 %

The same architectural class applies on Ampere SM 8.6 (A5000): same
register file size, same shared-memory layout class. The numerical
improvement transfers — actual wall-clock varies because A5000 has
6 % less SM count than A100 and 25 % of H100, but the *occupancy
fraction unlock* carries directly. Expected: ``-3-7 % decode_TPOT``
on Gemma 4 31B FP8 prefill on our PROD.

**Three changes in one method + kernel launch**:

  1. ``_get_tile_size`` (helper): add a fast-path for ``head_size >= 512
     and is_prefill and element_size == 1`` → return 64 (vs default
     32). Larger inner-K tile improves L2 reuse on large head dims.
     Restricted to FP8 element size because at BF16 the K+V shared
     memory would exceed the per-SM limit and the kernel would fail
     to launch (verified by author).

  2. ``unified_attention`` (caller): add two kwargs on the kernel
     ``triton_unified_attention[...](...)`` launch (multi-anchor,
     FOUR launch-site shapes — Variant D added 2026-07-02 for pin
     dev748 which inserted an ``MM_PREFIX_CLAMP_SW`` kwarg into the
     call site)::

         num_warps=8 if head_size >= 512 else 4,
         num_stages=2 if head_size >= 512 else 3,

     8 warps spreads the accumulator across more warps relieving
     register pressure; 2-stage pipeline is shallower but uses less
     shared memory (offsetting the larger tile size).

**What our PROD hits**:

  * Gemma 4 31B FP8: head_dim=512 → all three improvements fire on
    prefill. Decode is < 32 query tokens — different tile path.
  * Gemma 4 26B-A4B FP8: standard layer head_dim=256 (no change);
    global-attention heads have head_dim=512 → improvements fire on
    the global-attention layers (every 4th layer per Gemma 4 pattern).
  * Qwen3.6 35B FP8: head_dim=128 — no change (default 32-tile + 4w/3s
    preserved).
  * Qwen3.6 27B INT4: head_dim=128 — no change.

So PN351 is a Gemma-4-specific perf win; no-op on Qwen3.6 (preserves
current well-tuned defaults).

**Why we vendor an OPEN PR**:

  * 14-LOC diff, surgical, gated by ``head_size >= 512`` so the
    Qwen / FA2 / Mamba paths see ZERO change.
  * Author bench shows real occupancy unlock; same numerical class on
    Ampere SM 8.6.
  * No interaction with shmem budget — the FP8 gate keeps the
    K+V shared-memory footprint within ~99 KiB opt-in (the same
    constraint PN345 enforces precisely).

Implementation strategy
=======================

Two atomic sub-patches on a single file
(``v1/attention/ops/triton_unified_attention.py``):

  * Sub-1 (``_get_tile_size``): replace the docstring and add the
    ``head_size >= 512 and is_prefill and element_size == 1`` branch
    BEFORE the default behaviour. ``required=True`` — the
    ``_get_tile_size`` function is untouched by vllm#45151, so this
    anchor never breaks.
  * Sub-2 (``kernel_unified_attention`` launch): add ``num_warps`` and
    ``num_stages`` kwargs on the triton kernel call. MULTI-ANCHOR
    (batch-3 pin-bump protection). THREE launch-site shapes exist in
    the wild — verified 2026-06-13 against the live pin AND upstream
    ``main`` (``gh pr diff 45151`` + raw main fetch):

      * Variant A — our CURRENT pin ``g303916e93`` (0.22.1rc1.dev259):
        the call site ends ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n    )`` with NO
        ``**launch_kwargs,`` line. This is the only shape we run TODAY.
      * Variant B — future pin descended from upstream ``main`` but
        BEFORE #45151: ``main`` has refactored the launch to splat a
        ``**launch_kwargs,`` dict (native ``launch_num_warps`` /
        ``launch_num_stages`` machinery), so the tail is now
        ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n        **launch_kwargs,\n    )``.
      * Variant C — future pin AFTER #45151: the 7 fused-quant kwargs
        are spliced between ``USE_TD_QO`` and ``**launch_kwargs,`` →
        ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n<7 kwargs>\n        **launch_kwargs,\n    )``.

    All three variants are ``required=False`` under the P18B/PN32
    "at-least-one" convention; EXACTLY ONE matches on any given pin and
    the others soft-skip. apply() enforces that at least one fired (a
    tile-only apply is incoherent — Sub-1 sets the tile, Sub-2 sets the
    launch config; either alone is a no-op). In B and C our literal
    ``num_warps=``/``num_stages=`` kwargs are inserted BEFORE the
    ``**launch_kwargs,`` splat; they never collide with main's native
    ``launch_kwargs["num_warps"]`` because that is populated only on the
    ``tuned_large_head`` path (``head_size == 256`` + B200 device-cap-100),
    which is mutually exclusive with PN351's ``head_size >= 512`` gate and
    never fires on our A5000 SM 8.6 PROD. See the anchor-definition block
    below for the full upstream-main + #45151 diff derivation.

Composition + safety
====================

* No overlap with PN29x / PN345 (those target FLA chunk kernels — a
  different file). PN351 touches ``triton_unified_attention.py``
  which is the unified backend for full-attention layers.
* No overlap with PN340/PN341 (MTP decode bubbles — different files).
* Composes with all our existing patches.
* Risk: LOW — gated path; non-Gemma-4 models bypass it entirely.

# ── Sub-2: unified_attention kernel launch — add num_warps + num_stages ──
#
# MULTI-ANCHOR pin-bump protection (batch-3, 2026-06-13; corrected against
# the REAL upstream-main launch shape after review).
# =====================================================================
# The launch kwargs are appended at the ``kernel_unified_attention[grid](
# ... )`` call site, anchored on the existing CHUNK_SIZE / USE_TD /
# USE_TD_QO sequence and whatever trailing form the call site has.
#
# Verified 2026-06-13 against THREE concrete shapes:
#
# (A) CURRENT pin ``g303916e93`` (0.22.1rc1.dev259, the tree we run). The
#     call site has NO ``**launch_kwargs`` — its tail is literally:
#
#         USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,
#         )
#
#     Byte-verified: ``launch_kwargs``/``num_warps``/``num_stages`` all
#     count 0 in the pristine pin file.
#
# (B) Upstream ``main`` BEFORE #45151 (raw fetch 2026-06-13). main has
#     refactored the launch to splat a tuned-params dict — the tail is:
#
#         USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,
#         **launch_kwargs,
#         )
#
#     where ``launch_kwargs`` is built from native ``launch_num_warps`` /
#     ``launch_num_stages`` (populated ONLY on main's own ``tuned_large_head``
#     path: ``head_size == 256`` + ``is_device_capability_family(100)`` /
#     B200 — disjoint from PN351's ``head_size >= 512`` FP8 gate, so on our
#     A5000 path ``launch_kwargs`` is empty and our literal kwargs never
#     collide with a ``**launch_kwargs['num_warps']``).
#
# (C) Upstream ``main`` AFTER #45151 ("Fuse per-group FP8 dynamic quant
#     into Triton attention epilogue", OPEN). ``gh pr diff 45151`` inserts
#     SEVEN kwargs between ``USE_TD_QO`` and the existing ``**launch_kwargs,``
#     context line (the ``**launch_kwargs,`` is a CONTEXT line in the diff,
#     not an added line) — tail:
#
#         USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,
#         USE_FP8_GROUP=use_fp8_group,           <─┐
#         GROUP_SIZE=group_size,                   │
#         out_group_scale_ptr=output_group_scale,  │ 7 kwargs #45151 adds
#         out_group_scale_stride_0=(...),          │ between USE_TD_QO and
#         out_group_scale_stride_1=(...),          │ **launch_kwargs,
#         NUM_GROUPS_PER_HEAD=num_groups_per_head,  │
#         USE_UE8M0=output_group_ue8m0,          <─┘
#         **launch_kwargs,
#         )
#
# The earlier single-form ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n    )`` anchor matches
# ONLY shape (A). Both future shapes (B, C) end with ``**launch_kwargs,``
# before the ``)``, so the fix is a THREE-variant launch sub-patch under
# the P18B/PN32 "required-at-least-one" convention (all ``required=False``;
# apply() enforces at least one fired). On any given pin EXACTLY ONE
# variant's anchor is present (the shapes are mutually exclusive) so the
# others soft-skip. Behavior is byte-identical: every variant emits the
# same warps/stages kwargs. In B and C we insert BEFORE ``**launch_kwargs,``
# so main's splat still applies last.

# Variant A — CURRENT pin g303916e93 (no launch_kwargs). The 3-kwarg
# sequence is unique; the closing `)` follows USE_TD_QO directly.
