"""Wiring for Patch 91B — AutoRound row-group cdiv defensive coverage for
INC + compressed-tensors schemes (P91 sibling, vllm#39460-derived).

================================================================
SCOPE
================================================================

Same bug class as P91 (silent dequant corruption when
`input_size_per_partition % group_size != 0` or
`input_size % group_size != 0` for row-group quantized layers), but
in files that vllm#39460 did NOT touch. Three cdiv-only sub-patches
across three files.

================================================================
COVERED FILES (3 sub-patches)
================================================================

1. `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/inc.py` (Intel Neural
   Compressor linear method).
   Cross-pin anchor drift between two `KNOWN_GOOD_VLLM_PINS`:
     - `0.20.2rc1.dev338+gbf0d2dc6d` — uses `self.group_size`
     - `0.20.2rc1.dev371+gbf610c2f5` — uses bare `group_size`
   Two independent factories (`_make_inc_dev338_patcher`,
   `_make_inc_dev371_patcher`) each carry a distinct anchor. On any
   live pin exactly one of the two anchors matches; the other returns
   SKIPPED with anchor-not-found and is treated as expected per-pin
   alternation (Option A from Step 0 anchor manifest).

2. `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/compressed_tensors/schemes/`
   `compressed_tensors_wNa16.py`.
   One real bug at the REPEAT-all-ranks branch:
   `scales_and_zp_size = input_size // group_size`. The companion line
   inside `if partition_scales:` (`input_size_per_partition // group_size`)
   is assert-protected upstream (`assert input_size_per_partition %
   group_size == 0`) and not touched here — cdiv there would be a
   no-op rewrite since the assert guarantees exact divisibility.

3. `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/compressed_tensors/schemes/`
   `compressed_tensors_w4a8_fp8.py`.
   Same structural pattern as wNa16: one real bug at the unprotected
   REPEAT-all-ranks line, plus an assert-protected partition-scales
   line that is left alone.

================================================================
NOT COVERED (explicitly)
================================================================

- `compressed_tensors_w4a8_int.py` — the function-head
  `assert input_size_per_partition % effective_group_size == 0`
  proactively rejects partial-group shards before the floor-div at
  line 110 ever executes, so the floor-div is always exact when
  control reaches it. No silent-corruption surface to fix.

- inc.py `setattr(row_group_size, row_input_size_per_partition)`
  companion that would let P91's parameter.py loader gate fire on
  inc.py partial-group row-parallel scales. That is INFRASTRUCTURE
  for an existing fix (P91's `RowvLLMParameter.load_row_parallel_weight`
  group-aware branch) rather than a new bug fix, so it is out of
  scope for this defensive-coverage patch. inc.py cdiv-only fix here
  prevents over-allocation but a partial-group inc.py scales tensor
  still loads from the wrong offset under TP>=2. Deferred to a
  future refresh phase if INC enters Genesis prod use.

================================================================
RELATIONSHIP TO P91
================================================================

Same bug CLASS, different FILES. Per
`_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS = frozenset({"backport"})`, only
`backport` permits status-based retire on upstream merge. P91B uses
`related_not_superseding` so it stays even if vllm#39460 ever
merges (#39460 would not retroactively touch inc.py or the
compressed_tensors files).

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- `cdiv(x, group_size) >= floor(x // group_size)` always; equal when
  x is divisible. The change can only INCREASE allocated rows, never
  shrink — no chance of breaking checkpoints that previously loaded fine.
- Default OFF (env-gated via `GENESIS_ENABLE_P91B=1`, dispatcher-applied).
  When OFF, behavior is upstream nightly.
- Idempotent via `GENESIS_P91B_MARKER_BASE` substring check per file.

K.1.R anchor audit 2026-05-28

Significant drift detected against new pin nightly-626fa9bb (multi-arch digest
sha256:674922aae790c2cbf45f4e844098d227b80d40a74bfc7797a444d213a221879f,
upstream SHA 626fa9bba5663a5cf6a870debf031ee344ddb822):

  * ``inc.py`` — 1 of 4 anchors PASS; 3 of 4 DRIFT including the
    primary ``P91B_INC_DEV338_ANCHOR``, ``P91B_W4A8_FP8_ANCHOR``,
    ``P91B_WNA16_ANCHOR``. Upstream refactored ``inc.py`` such that
    the ``scales_and_zp_size = input_size_per_partition // ...`` pattern
    no longer appears in the new source — the bug class P91B targets
    may have been resolved by an unrelated upstream restructure, OR
    moved to a parent class we'd need to walk.

Status under new pin: TextPatcher per-anchor self-skip; ``apply()``
returns ``skipped`` for the inc.py sub-patches. P91B remains default-OFF
opt-in only — runtime on new pin is unchanged for everyone not enabling
the multi-scheme cdiv overlay.

Re-anchoring P91B against the new inc.py is non-trivial because the
target code surface (`scales_and_zp_size = ...`) has been refactored
out of inc.py entirely. A separate analysis slice would need to:
  1. Walk the new inc.py inheritance chain to find where scales_and_zp
     are computed.
  2. Confirm whether the floor-div bug class still manifests on AutoRound
     INT4/INT8 checkpoints (it may have been resolved by the same
     restructure).
  3. Either re-anchor against the new code surface or retire P91B as
     incidentally-fixed-by-restructure.

For now: keep self-skip behaviour; document deferred re-anchor status
above. Operator opt-in remains technically possible (env flag is read)
but produces clean no-op apply.

Status correction 2026-06-11 (preflight residual triage §2)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The K.1.R 2026-05-28 claim above ("refactored out of inc.py entirely")
is STALE on the current pin 0.22.1rc1.dev259+g303916e93: the pattern is
back at pristine ``inc.py:538`` —
``scales_and_zp_size = input_size_per_partition // group_size``
(bare ``group_size``, the dev371-style spelling) — so the dev371
factory's anchor matches again and the floor-div silent-corruption
surface re-exists upstream. The dual-factory alternation (Option A from
the Step 0 anchor manifest) is working as designed: whichever of the
dev338 / dev371 factories matches the live pin applies; the dev338
factory stays while that pin remains in ``KNOWN_GOOD_VLLM_PINS``.
Preflight sweeps should classify the non-matching factory as
EXPECTED_ALTERNATE, not drift.
