"""Retired Genesis patches — archived wirings, kept for audit trail.

A patch lands here when one of these holds:
 1. Upstream merged the same fix (within a known vllm_version_range).
 2. Hypothesis disproven empirically (retired_waiver=True with explanation).
 3. Duplicate of another active patch (superseded_by set).
 4. Deprecated mechanism (workaround replaced by root-cause fix).

Registry entries stay (with `lifecycle: "retired"`) so dispatcher logs and
audit gates can report drift. Modules here are imported via legacy hooks
(`_per_patch_dispatch.py`) and the `bundles/reasoning_qwen3.py` bundle to
preserve boot order; their `apply()` returns "skipped: retired" or is a
harmless no-op (anchor never matches in retire-eligible state).
