"""PN364 — vendor of OPEN PR vllm#43642 (hybrid GDN/Mamba/MRoPE startup warmup).

Closes the LAST first-request JIT spikes that PN126-130 do NOT cover
====================================================================

After PN126 (V1 decode warmup orchestrator), PN128 (spec-decode helper
warmup), PN129 (slot mapping warmup), PN130 (TurboQuant decode warmup),
there are still 4-5 kernels that fire JIT on the first user request:

  * ``_causal_conv1d_update_kernel`` (DECODE shape — distinct from
    ``_causal_conv1d_fwd_kernel`` covered by PN126 Pass 1 prefill)
  * ``fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_packed_decode_kernel`` (GDN
    single-token decode path — NOT covered by any existing PN12*)
  * ``MRotaryEmbedding.forward_cuda`` first-shape variant
  * ``layer_norm_fwd_kernel`` variants exercised by GDN/Mamba mixers
  * ``_kv_block_zeroer.warmup()`` if available

Verified by previous-session journal "2026-06-09-deep-dive-bugfix-followup.md"
section "Next actionable steps #1" listing 10 JIT-spike kernels still
firing on first user request.

Vendor strategy: PR #43642's design is "model-side warmup helper +
worker-side scheduler-warmup hook". We backport the SAME idea via a
single extra warmup pass triggered at the end of PN126's chain.

What PN364 does at boot
=======================

After PN126/PN128/PN129/PN130 finish their passes, PN364 runs:

  1. Pre-touch ``MRotaryEmbedding.forward_cuda`` with a fixed
     synthetic decode-shape tensor — bakes the first-call shape
     into Triton's autotune cache.
  2. Run an extra ``_dummy_run`` with the GDN decode-specific shape
     ``num_tokens = max_num_seqs × 1`` (single-token decode,
     NOT spec-decode multi-token shape covered by PN126 Pass 2).
     This is the path that fires
     ``_causal_conv1d_update_kernel`` +
     ``fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_packed_decode_kernel``.
  3. Pre-touch ``_kv_block_zeroer.warmup()`` if available on the runner.

All passes wrapped in try/except — partial completion is acceptable;
worst case is the pre-PN364 behaviour (those few kernels JIT on first
user request).

Why this composes cleanly with PN126/PN128/PN129/PN130
======================================================

  * PN126 = orchestrator wrapper around ``Worker.compile_or_warm_up_model``;
    issues Pass 1 (prefill) + Pass 2 (uniform spec-decode shape) +
    Pass 3 (extra capture sizes).
  * PN128 = wraps ``Worker.compile_or_warm_up_model`` to warm
    specific spec-decode helper kernels (eagle_prepare_*, etc.).
  * PN129 = slot_mapping_kernel warmup.
  * PN130 = TurboQuant decode kernels warmup.

PN364 ALSO wraps ``Worker.compile_or_warm_up_model`` but runs LAST in
the chain (registered later in dispatch order). All five patches use
the same wrapper-chaining pattern → naturally compose. Different
kernel-target sets → zero overlap.

  * **Single-token decode** (PN364's pass 2 ``max_num_seqs × 1``)
    is DISTINCT from PN126 Pass 2's ``max_num_seqs × (1 + num_spec)``
    spec-decode-uniform shape. Different cudagraph capture bucket.
  * **MRotaryEmbedding** is downstream of attention; no PN12*
    touches it.
  * **KV block zeroer** is a memory-mgmt kernel; no PN12* touches it.

Expected impact
===============

  * **TTFT on first user request after restart**: -200 ms to -1500 ms
    (kills the GDN single-token-decode + MRoPE first-call JIT spikes).
  * **Steady-state wall_TPS**: unchanged in the mean. **CV should
    tighten** because no JIT spike events mid-bench → less variance.
  * **Stability metric improvement** (operator's main complaint area):
    same patches → same kernels → identical autotune state → less drift
    between bench runs.

Safety model
============

  * Default OFF — opt-in via GENESIS_ENABLE_PN364_HYBRID_GDN_WARMUP=1.
  * Disable via GENESIS_DISABLE_PN364=1.
  * Idempotent via marker attribute on wrapped method.
  * Auto-skip when VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1 (V2's own warmup
    covers these kernels natively per PR43642 design).
  * Auto-skip when enforce_eager=True (no cudagraph capture).
  * Auto-skip when model has no hybrid GDN+Mamba layers (the
    helper detects via ``has_hybrid_gdn_mamba_mrope(model)``
    pattern from upstream PR).
  * Try/except wraps every pass — partial failure is acceptable.

#
# Idempotency now uses the per-class ``GENESIS_PN364_MARKER`` attr on

    naming drift on minor refactors doesn't break the detection.
