"""PN399 — TurboQuant decode-scratch fixed buffer (fix CUDA IMA in FULL cudagraph).

Genesis backport of OPEN vllm#46067 ([Bugfix][TurboQuant] Fix CUDA
illegal memory access in FULL cudagraph), re-authored against live
dev148 (pin ``0.23.1rc1.dev148+gb4c80ec0f``) and COMPOSED with PN118.

Problem
-------
TQ decode runs inside the FULL cudagraph, so the decode-scratch tensor
addresses are baked into the captured graphs at capture time. The
growable ``WorkspaceManager`` is NOT safe to back that scratch: it
``free``s + reallocs (it calls ``empty_cache()``, unmapping the old
address) whenever it has to grow — across the ``B=1..max`` capture sweep
or on a long continuation-prefill — freeing an address that an earlier
(smaller-batch) captured graph still points at. First replay of that
graph then triggers a CUDA illegal memory access.

Fix
---
Allocate a fixed module-level ``_DECODE_SCRATCH`` ONCE at the largest
CUDA-graph decode batch (``max_cudagraph_capture_size``), reused by every
TQ layer (layers run sequentially) and every captured decode graph,
sliced ``[:B]`` per call (native kernel contract:
``triton_turboquant_decode.py`` slices ``mid_o_buf[:B]`` etc. under
``.shape[0] >= B``). A dedicated buffer sized up front for ``max_batch``
never moves, so the addresses baked into the FULL cudagraphs stay valid.

Consolidated single-owner design (compose + de-dup, NOT retire)
---------------------------------------------------------------
PN399 OWNS the TQ decode-scratch lifecycle. It anchors the LIVE (PN118 +
PN353A patched) output and transforms it — the PN118/PN353A SOURCE files
are NOT edited (only registry composes_with notes). Five sub-patches:

  * A  — module-level ``_DECODE_SCRATCH`` dict + ``_get_decode_scratch``
    + ``reset_tq_decode_scratch`` after the live module constants.
  * B' — ``__init__``: INSERT ``self.max_decode_cudagraph_batch`` AND
    REMOVE the now-dead PN118 ``__init__`` ``_reserve_decode_workspace``
    box + call + method (one consolidated hunk over live 381-426).
  * C  — ``_decode_attention``: insert the CG-path ``_get_decode_scratch``
    branch BEFORE PN118's ``if is_workspace_manager_initialized():`` and
    convert that ``if`` to ``elif``. PN118's ``try_get_simultaneous`` +
    ``torch.empty`` body is left BYTE-UNCHANGED as the eager / over-max
    cold path (the safety net for ``enforce_eager`` / ``B > max_batch``).
  * C2 — ``TurboQuantMetadataBuilder._reserve_workspace``: REMOVE the
    now-dead decode-scratch ``get_simultaneous`` reservation. PIN-SPLIT
    (two mutually-exclusive ``required=False`` siblings): on dev148 the
    reservation lives in PN353A's injected text (``_genesis_pn353a_torch``
    form); on dev301 ``vllm#44053`` MERGED so the reservation is
    UPSTREAM-NATIVE inside ``_reserve_workspace`` (PN353A retired, anchors
    0x). Each sibling targets its own pin's form; exactly one matches. The
    CONTINUATION-PREFILL K/V reservation is KEPT BYTE-INTACT on both —
    PN399 never touches the prefill path (proven distinct call sites on
    live bytes: separated by the ``reserve_continuation_prefill`` gate +
    early return).
  * D  — ``gpu/shutdown.py``: ``reset_tq_decode_scratch`` import + call.

Why removals B'/C2 are safe: the PN118/PN353A decode reservations only
pre-GREW the WorkspaceManager so a later lazy ``get_simultaneous`` would
not hit "locked + undersized". Once ``_DECODE_SCRATCH`` owns the CG-path
fixed buffer (which never grows or locks), that pre-grow is dead on the
hot path. The cold path (eager / ``B > max_batch``) still works: PN118's
``try_get_simultaneous`` returns ``None`` on an undersized workspace ->
the ``torch.empty`` one-shot fires — PN118's designed behavior, WITHOUT
the boot reserve. This single-owner consolidation is BETTER than upstream
#46067, which has neither PN118 nor PN353A to de-duplicate.

With PN399 OFF/unapplied it produces ZERO change: PN118 (and, on dev148,
PN353A) keep owning decode + their reservations (the current crash-free
PROD behavior). PN399 ``requires_patches: [PN118, P101]`` and is placed in
the registry AFTER both (so the PN118 ``__init__`` box + decode head and
the P101 module const — which the A/B'/C anchors target — exist as applied
output when PN399 runs). The C2 decode-reserve removal needs no `requires`:
on dev148 it targets PN353A's applied text, on dev301 the upstream-native
``_reserve_workspace`` (vllm#44053) which exists regardless of any Genesis
patch. PN353A was DROPPED from ``requires_patches`` on the dev148->dev301
re-anchor (it is retired on dev301; the native form supplies the anchor).

Lifecycle
---------
``default_on=False``, ``lifecycle=experimental``. On our PROD (35B FP8 +
MTP K=3 + TQ k8v4, capture set [4,8,16], max_batch=16) the live IMA is
ALREADY neutralized by PN118 + PN353A + SNDR_WORKSPACE_001 (5h clean), so
PN399 is a belt-and-suspenders backport pending rig validation at the
next pin-upgrade window — not yet promoted to default_on.

Self-skip
---------
``_get_decode_scratch`` and ``max_decode_cudagraph_batch`` are the
``upstream_drift_markers``: once a pin carries #46067 natively (these
symbols present), PN399 self-skips before touching the file.

# 381-426):
#   (1) INSERT self.max_decode_cudagraph_batch right after the kv_splits
#       assignment (the PR's __init__ attr).
#   (2) REMOVE the now-dead PN118 __init__ decode-workspace reservation:
#       the box comment, the self._reserve_decode_workspace(vllm_config)
#       call, AND the def _reserve_decode_workspace(...) method body. Once
#       _DECODE_SCRATCH owns the CG-path fixed buffer the pre-grow of the
#       WorkspaceManager to decode rows before lock is dead weight (cut to
#       reclaim boot overhead). The cold-path safety net is unaffected:
#       PN118's try_get_simultaneous + torch.empty in _decode_attention
#       (the eager elif from sub-patch C) lands on try_get -> None ->
#       torch.empty when the WorkspaceManager is undersized, exactly

# Sub-patch C2-native — DEV301 RE-ANCHOR (vllm#44053 merged). On dev301 the

# `_reserve_workspace` method (native #44053) that does the SAME decode-scratch
# `get_simultaneous` pre-grow PN353A used to inject — but in native text, so
# PN353A is retired (its `_genesis_pn353a_torch` form anchors 0x on dev301) and
# the PN353A-form C2 sub-patch above no longer matches. This sibling re-anchors
# the SAME removal onto the native `_reserve_workspace` body: it excises the
# native decode-scratch `get_simultaneous` (lines that pre-grow the
# WorkspaceManager to (max_num_reqs, num_heads, max_num_splits, head_size+1)/f32
# + 2 more — exactly the buffers _DECODE_SCRATCH now owns on the CG path) PLUS
# the now-dead `max_num_splits` assignment that ONLY that reservation consumed.
# The native continuation-prefill K/V reservation (the second get_simultaneous,
# guarded by reserve_continuation_prefill) is KEPT BYTE-INTACT — PN399 never
# touches the prefill path. Anchored from the `max_num_splits = (...)` assignment
# through the decode reservation, DOWN TO the `reserve_continuation_prefill = (`
# line, which is re-emitted UNCHANGED so the continuation-prefill block below is
# preserved verbatim. Byte-confirmed unique (count=1) on dev301 pristine AND on
# the post-PN118/post-P101 applied-state (P101 only touches the module const +
# the continuation slicer, not `_reserve_workspace`). required=False so it and
# the PN353A-form sibling are mutually exclusive across pins: dev148 matches the
# PN353A form, dev301 matches this native form; A/B'/C (the perf carriers) stay
