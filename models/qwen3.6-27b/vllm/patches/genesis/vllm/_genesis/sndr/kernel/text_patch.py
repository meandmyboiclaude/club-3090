"""SNDR Core — TextPatcher (canonical home for per-file text patching).

Per-file text-patching primitive. Used by every SNDR Core / Genesis
patch wiring to apply anchor→replacement edits to one target file
in the installed vllm tree.

Why text-patches (vs pure monkey-patch)
----------------------------------------
Some upstream code sites are not cleanly monkey-patchable:

  - Raises inside a method body (e.g. `arg_utils.py` `if model_config.is_hybrid:
    raise NotImplementedError(...)`) — bypassing requires re-defining
    ~50 lines of upstream logic that drifts between vLLM versions.
  - Compile-time Triton kernel literals (e.g. `BLOCK_KV=4, num_warps=1`
    as immediate args to `@triton.jit`) — baked into kernel compilation,
    cannot be overridden at call site.
  - Control-flow that depends on local variable state only available
    inside the original function (no clean rebind point).

For those, surgical text-replacement at plugin-register time is
pragmatic: small, targeted, verifiable, far less invasive than full
method rewrite.

Migration history:
  - Original: vllm/_genesis/wiring/text_patch.py (833 LOC monolith).
  - Stage 3 (CURRENT): split into core/{text_patch.py, multi_file.py,
    manifest_cache.py}. The legacy `wiring/text_patch.py` becomes a
    thin re-export shim for back-compat.

    v11.3.0 FATAL BUG FIX. Replaces `os.access(path, os.W_OK)` which
    has a Python-stdlib documented quirk: it ignores CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
    (root's blanket file-permission override). When the container runs
    as root and upstream vllm files are owned by uid != 0 (typical:
    pip install runs as uid 1000 under nightly-image build), the
    legacy os.access returned False — the patcher then SKIPPED with
    "read_only_mount" despite the kernel being perfectly happy to
    write. Caused ~50% of our text-patches (P67, PN12, PN95, etc.) to
    silently no-op in production for ~weeks.

    The fix: actually open the file for read+write (no actual write
    happens — open(r+b) just verifies the OS would permit it). This
    matches what subsequent write would experience.

    Returns True if the file can be opened with r+b mode (writable),

        Runs the same idempotency / upstream-drift / anchor checks as
        ``apply()`` (Layers 1, 2, 3, 5) but stops before Layer 7 (write). It
        exists so the dry-run apply path can report a result grounded in the
        actual anchors instead of a bare "applied" that only proved the module
        imported (the false-green the drift watcher was meant to catch, but
        which the per-boot dry-run silently reproduced).

        Contract (mirrors ``apply()`` minus the mutation):
          APPLIED     → every required anchor matched; the patch WOULD apply
                        (nothing written).

                        ambiguous. ``failure.reason`` names which.

        Layer 4 (writability) is intentionally NOT checked here: validate()
        answers "do the anchors still line up", a pure content question that
        must succeed even against a read-only pristine clone (CI drift gate).
