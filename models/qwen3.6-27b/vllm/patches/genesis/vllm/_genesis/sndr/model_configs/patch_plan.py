"""Patch-plan resolver — Phase B of the patch-attribution integration plan.

The resolver answers the question "given a composed ModelConfig and a
policy name, which env-flag entries should the runtime actually
include?". It does *not* override the dispatcher's runtime decision
(``should_apply()``); it is a *read-only* explanation layer used by
``sndr patches plan --explain`` and (in Phase C) ``sndr compose
render --policy``.

Contract:

  PatchPlan
    .policy      "compat" | "safe" | "minimal"
    .included    tuple of PatchDecision (env_flag stays in the runtime)
    .excluded    tuple of PatchDecision (env_flag dropped, with reason)
    .warnings    tuple of strings (advisory only; never blocking here)

  PatchDecision per entry carries patch_id, env_flag, value, role,
  reason, note, bench_evidence — everything a CLI explainer needs.

Policy semantics:

  compat  : pass-through. Every flag in cfg.genesis_env with value != "0"
            is included. Excluded set holds only operator-disabled
            (value == "0") entries — so compose render can still tell
            "operator put this here on purpose" from "patch never was on".

  safe    : compat + drop role == "no_op".
            Operator-visible payoff: shorter env block, fewer red
            herrings in diagnose runs. Conservative — won't drop
            anything that *might* be doing work.

  minimal : safe + drop role in {"suspected_regression", "unknown"}.
            For advanced operators who curated attribution and want a
            lean stack. Unknowns are dropped because by definition
            we cannot defend their inclusion in a minimal preset.

See `docs/_internal/PATCH_ATTRIBUTION_COMPOSE_GENERATOR_INTEGRATION_PLAN_2026-05-16_RU.md`
§ 6 for the algorithm and § 5.4 for the data shape.
