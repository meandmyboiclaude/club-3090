"""PN383 — KV-offload + MTP cuMemcpyBatchAsync segfault gate (vendor of
OPEN PR vllm#44784) plus two Genesis extensions.

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired): vllm#44784 MERGED 2026-06-16 and
pristine dev748 ships the eagle-group offload gating natively — EVOLVED past
both Genesis extensions (``is_eagle_group`` is a first-class KVCacheGroup
field set by the engine core, superseding the 'mtp'-prefix narrowing; the
volatile trailing block is excluded at scheduler level, removing the OOB
source the pre-DMA bounds check defended against). The 0.22.x
``offloading_connector.py`` monolith these anchors target no longer exists
(split into the ``offloading/`` package). Kept for reference.

Precision note (retirement re-verified by code 2026-07-05): a file NAMED
``offloading_connector.py`` still exists on dev748, but it is a ~215-line
delegating shell importing from the ``offloading/`` package — the 0.22.x
single-file implementation these anchors target is what is gone. Do not
mistake the surviving filename for a wrong retirement: the native gating
lives in ``offloading/scheduler.py`` (``is_eagle_group`` field :92, use
:174/:215/:512; volatile-trailing-block exclusion :89-90, :490).

Upstream #44784 (issue #44780): ``OffloadingConnectorScheduler`` schedules
EAGLE/MTP draft-attention groups into the store/load paths. The draft
group's trailing block is rewritten by the drafter every decode step (no
stable hash) and uses tiny ``gpu_block_size`` values, so the block math
``num_gpu_blocks = cdiv(420K, small_size)`` produces an out-of-bounds GPU
block index that segfaults silently inside ``cuMemcpyBatchAsync``. This
blocks native CPU KV offload on EVERY MTP config, ours included (Qwen3.6
MTP K=3). The PR's four ``scheduler.py`` hunks:

  1. ``is_eagle_group`` field on ``GroupOffloadConfig``.
  2. eagle-group detection in ``SchedulerOffloadConfig.from_spec``.
  3. eagle handling inside ``_lookup`` (query one extra block + pop of the
     volatile trailing block, gated on a per-iteration ``_pn383_eagle_verified``
     set that a tightening non-eagle group clears).
  4. trailing-block exclusion in ``_build_store_jobs``.

Plus the PR's defense-in-depth ``gpu_worker.py`` pre-DMA bounds check.

Genesis extensions over upstream (roadmap chunk-4 Theme 5 — verified
against the pristine pin 0.22.1rc1.dev259+g303916e93):

  1. Qwen3.6-specific ``is_eagle_group`` flagging. On the pin
     ``KVCacheGroupSpec.is_eagle_group`` is only ever set by the DeepSeek V4
     annotation path; for Qwen3.5/3.6 MTP it stays False on every group, so
     upstream's fallback flags ALL groups as eagle — every group then loses
     its trailing block from store/load, costing prefix-reuse hit-rate
     across the whole target model. PN383 narrows the fallback: when nothing
     is annotated, first flag only groups whose layer names live under the
     drafter ``mtp`` module prefix (the Qwen3.5/3.6 MTP drafter convention).
     The all-groups fallback stays as a LOUD last resort (warning logged).

  2. Re-add the pre-DMA bounds check the upstream PR described for
     ``gpu_worker.py`` but dropped from its final diff: validate the GPU
     block ids against the per-tensor row counts BEFORE the descriptor
     pointers are computed, raising a clear ``RuntimeError`` instead of a
     silent CUDA segfault.

Dormant by design: ``default_on=False``, opt-in via
``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN383_OFFLOAD_MTP_EAGLE_GATE``. The patched behavior is
only reachable when a KV offloading backend is configured (none on today's
PROD). Self-skips when #44784 lands upstream via the drift markers below.
