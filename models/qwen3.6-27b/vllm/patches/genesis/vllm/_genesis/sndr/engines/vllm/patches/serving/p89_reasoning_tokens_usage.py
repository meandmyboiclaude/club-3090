"""P89 — completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens in chat usage (vendor of vllm#45471).

Upstream gap (vllm#45471, DRAFT as of 2026-06-13, "[Frontend] Add
completion_token_details to usage object in Chat Completions response
body"): the ``/v1/chat/completions`` ``usage`` object exposes
``prompt_tokens_details`` but NOT ``completion_tokens_details``. OpenAI's
chat API surfaces ``completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`` so a
caller can attribute decode cost between the chain-of-thought and the
answer. In our pin the ``/v1/responses`` path already surfaces it
(``responses/serving.py`` calls ``count_reasoning_tokens`` →
``OutputTokensDetails(reasoning_tokens=...)``) but the chat path — which
every Genesis client actually uses — does not.

LIVE RELEVANCE on our stack: all 4 PROD models run the qwen3 reasoning
parser (``<think>...</think>``). The chat usage object therefore drops
the single most useful per-request signal: how many of the completion
tokens were reasoning. Surfacing it is a TPOT-attribution lever
(reasoning vs answer) and a denominator for MTP/TurboQuant tuning, at
ZERO GPU cost — the count is one O(n) token-id walk over already-emitted
ids via the parser's existing ``count_reasoning_tokens`` (depth counter
over start/end ``<think>`` ids; ``basic_parsers.py`` in the pin).

Vendor of OPEN PR vllm#45471 (studied via ``gh pr view`` + ``gh pr
diff`` 2026-06-13), 3 source hunks, adapted to the pin's file layout:

  * ``entrypoints/openai/engine/protocol.py`` — add the
    ``CompletionTokenUsageInfo`` model and wire
    ``UsageInfo.completion_tokens_details``.
  * ``entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py`` — import the new
    model; in ``chat_completion_stream_generator`` declare a per-choice
    token-id accumulator, extend it each decode step, and attach the
    reasoning count to the final usage chunk; in
    ``chat_completion_full_generator`` attach the reasoning count to the
    response usage. Both attach sites are gated on
    ``self.reasoning_parser_cls`` so non-reasoning models are byte-
    inert.

GENESIS EXTENSION the PR explicitly defers (its model only carries
``reasoning_tokens``; the PR description: "can be extended in the future
to include stuff like specdec token data"): we add the OpenAI-spec-
aligned ``accepted_prediction_tokens`` / ``rejected_prediction_tokens``
fields to ``CompletionTokenUsageInfo`` (default ``None``), forward-
compatible for surfacing MTP K=3 spec-decode efficiency per request.

  HONEST PLUMBING NOTE (verified against pristine pin g303916e93, iron
  rule #11): per-request accepted/rejected spec-decode counts are NOT
  reachable at the frontend in this pin. ``SpecDecodingStats``
  (``v1/spec_decode/metrics.py``: ``num_draft_tokens`` /
  ``num_accepted_tokens``) lives on ``IterationStats`` — an engine-STEP
  aggregate consumed by Prometheus, NOT per request. The per-request
  ``RequestOutput.metrics`` is ``RequestStateStats``, which has NO
  accept/draft fields. Threading a per-request MTP counter through
  EngineCore → output processor → ``RequestOutput`` is a separate
  hot-path-touching change, well beyond this S-effort frontend vendor.
  So P89 ships the SCHEMA (so the cost-parsing in Genesis_proxy_ai /
  agregator and the bench/dashboard can rely on a stable field shape)
  with the two prediction-token fields ``None`` until that plumbing
  lands (tracked as a Wave-3 follow-up). The bench note keys on
  ``reasoning_tokens`` today: ``tools/genesis_chat_matrix_bench.py``
  reads ``usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`` from the
  final streaming usage chunk and reports a per-variant "reason tok"
  column (the reasoning-vs-answer TPOT-attribution denominator and the
  MTP/TurboQuant tuning lever). The prediction fields are reserved.

GENESIS DIVERGENCE — spelling only (documented per iron rule #10): the
PR attaches via a bare ``final_usage.completion_tokens_details =
CompletionTokenUsageInfo(...)``. Our final-usage attachment carries a
distinguishing inline comment so the PR's exact structural lines stay
usable as upstream drift markers without ever matching our own emitted
text (tools/lint_drift_markers.py self-collision contract). The
``CompletionTokenUsageInfo`` model body also diverges (it carries the
two extra prediction-token fields), so the PR's exact model block is a
clean drift marker too.

Rebind analysis (verified against pristine pin g303916e93): both targets
are pure-Python frontend modules imported at server start, before any
request; a source-level text patch applied before import needs NO
runtime rebind. ``CompletionTokenUsageInfo`` is referenced only from
``serving.py`` (which the same patch imports it into) and instantiated
at the two attach sites — no other consumer exists in the pin (zero hits
for ``completion_tokens_details`` outside the responses path's distinct
``OutputTokensDetails``).

Atomicity: the two edits are one logical change (the model must exist
before ``serving.py`` instantiates it), so they apply through a
``MultiFilePatchTransaction`` — both files take the patch or neither
does, with true rollback on a commit-phase race.

Activation: opt-in via ``GENESIS_ENABLE_P89_REASONING_TOKENS_USAGE=1``
(default OFF in the registry). Self-skips when #45471 lands upstream:
drift markers below are exact substrings of the PR's form.

DUAL-ANCHOR re-anchoring (pin bump dev259 -> dev491, validation window)
— the dev491 candidate pin ``0.22.1rc1.dev491+g1033ffac2`` ships the
#45171 ``chat_completion/serving.py`` refactor, which moved three of the
five serving anchors while leaving ``engine/protocol.py`` byte-identical:

  * accumulator_decl — #45171 deleted the
    ``# Always track previous_texts for comprehensive output logging``
    comment; the bare ``previous_texts`` line now stands alone before
    the streaming ``try:`` block.
  * stream_attach — the prompt_tokens_details guard tightened from
    ``and num_cached_tokens:`` to ``and num_cached_tokens is not None:``.
  * full_attach — the same guard was split across multiple lines
    (``if (`` ... ``is not None`` ... ``):``).

P89 (authored TODAY against dev259, default-OFF) now carries BOTH a
dev259 and a dev491 anchor variant for each moved site, using the
PN32/P18B required-at-least-one convention (each variant declared
``required=False``; the TextPatcher kernel soft-skips the absent variant
and SKIPs only when BOTH miss). Mutual exclusivity is byte-verified:
each dev259 variant matches count==1 in the dev259 tree and count==0 in
the dev491 tree, and vice versa, so exactly one variant per pair fires
per pin. PROD 35B stays on dev259 until dev491 is validated, so the
dev259 variants are retained for the whole validation window — they are
NOT deleted. The two sites #45171 did not move (import, accumulator
extend) keep their single ``required=True`` anchor (identical bytes in
both pins). protocol.py needed no re-anchor (count==1 in both trees).

# 0.23.1 (pin 0.23.1rc1.dev101+g4c6266331) variant — REDESIGN. The #45171
# parser-unification refactor replaced the inline prompt_tokens_details
# guard block (the dev259/dev491 anchors above) with a
# ``_make_prompt_tokens_details(...)`` helper call, and removed the
# ``self.reasoning_parser_cls`` gate the dev259/dev491 bodies relied on
# (verified live: that attribute no longer exists). Reasoning/tool parsing
# is now folded into a single per-choice ``Parser`` (built earlier in the
# same ``chat_completion_stream_generator`` method as ``parsers:
# list[Parser | None]``) whose ``.reasoning_parser`` property exposes the
# unchanged ``count_reasoning_tokens`` walk. ``parsers`` is guaranteed
# bound at the ``include_usage`` block because the parser-creation
# ``except`` RETURNs before reaching it. Anchor + replacement are
# byte-exact, count==1 verified on the live 0.23.1 container; the new
# attach variant is ``required=True`` so a future silent drift SKIPs
# loudly. Non-reasoning models stay byte-inert (every parser's
