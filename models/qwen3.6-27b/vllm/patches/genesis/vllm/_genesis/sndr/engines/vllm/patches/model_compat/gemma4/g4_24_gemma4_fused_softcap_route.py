"""G4_24 — route Gemma 4 FINAL-LOGITS softcap through fused Triton kernel.

RETIRED 2026-06-19 (dev148 TIER-1 audit): superseded by vLLM's native
softcap LogitsProcessor (on-device softcap, no host round-trip). The
fused-softcap route had a per-token GPU->CPU sync stall (the wrapper read
a scalar back to host each decode step) that negated the fusion win on the
A5000 decode hot path. lifecycle=retired, default_on stays False, and the
route is de-wired. The Triton kernel file (kernels/g4_softcap_triton.py) is
KEPT as a library for future re-use — only this route is retired.

STATUS (audit 2026-05-17): implementation_status=partial.
This patch currently fuses ONLY the final-logits softcap site. The
attention-logits softcap (every layer × forward) is NOT yet fused —
that work is deferred to **G4_24b** which needs an anchor patch into
the attention backend's pre-softmax softcap call. See P2 roadmap.

================================================================
PURPOSE
================================================================

Gemma 4 has 2 softcap call sites:

  1. ``Gemma4Attention.forward`` — soft-caps attention logits in every
     layer (60 layers × forward = 60 calls per token).
     **NOT covered by G4_24** — see G4_24b roadmap.
  2. ``Gemma4ForCausalLM.compute_logits`` — soft-caps final logits
     before sampling (1 call per token).
     **COVERED by G4_24.**

Each call site is 3 sequential element-wise kernels:
``(x / softcap)`` → ``tanh(...)`` → ``(... * softcap)``.

This patch routes site #2 (final-logits) through our fused Triton
kernel (``g4_softcap_triton.py``), saving 2 of every 3 kernel launches
for the final-logits call.

Expected gain: **negligible (<0.5% TPS)** in the current state.
Real gain (~3-5% on decode at low batch) is achievable only after
G4_24b ports the attention-logits softcap to the fused kernel.

================================================================
INTEGRATION STRATEGY
================================================================

We monkey-patch the Gemma4Attention and Gemma4ForCausalLM classes at
apply time. The hook intercepts the softcap-applying code path and
calls our fused kernel instead of the 3-step sequence.

For each site we find:
  * the original ``forward`` (attention) or ``compute_logits`` method
  * scan for the softcap signature pattern
  * wrap the method to call ``g4_softcap()`` for the softcap step

Falls back gracefully when:
  * softcap value is None / 0 (no-op)
  * Triton is unavailable
  * shape doesn't match expected pattern

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

* default_on: False (perf opt-in; default OFF until A/B validated)
* env_flag: GENESIS_ENABLE_G4_24_GEMMA4_FUSED_SOFTCAP
* applies_to:
    - architecture: gemma4
    - triton ≥ 2.3
    - softcap value is non-None and non-zero
* conflicts_with: G4_15 (different sites — orthogonal in practice but
  both monkey-patch attention forward — apply order matters; G4_24
  should be applied AFTER G4_15 to layer on top)
