"""SNDR Core / Genesis brand strings (single source of truth).

Per Sander decision Q2 (2026-05-07, mixed approach):

    Backport patches from upstream PRs (vllm-project/vllm#NNNNN,
    SGLang#NNNN, llama.cpp#NNNN) keep the `Genesis ` marker prefix
    and `GENESIS_ENABLE_*` env vars. They are community-tier work
    that retains the established community brand.

    Sander-original patches (genesis-original Triton kernels, custom
    DFlash work, Sander-IP innovations) use `SNDR ` marker prefix
    and `SNDR_ENABLE_*` env vars. These are the canonical brand
    going forward for new Sander-IP work.

    Patcher Layer-1 marker check (vllm/_genesis/wiring/text_patch.py
    `_is_already_applied()`) recognizes BOTH prefixes — neither
    supersedes the other. Boot-time apply produces a status report
    showing how many patches use each prefix.

Public-facing brand: "Genesis (powered by SNDR Core)" for community,
"Genesis Pro (powered by SNDR Engine)" for commercial tier.

Why two prefixes coexist:
  Marker strings are baked into installed vllm files (prepended at
  apply time). Renaming `Genesis P15 …` → `SNDR P15 …` retroactively
  would break idempotency on every running container — they would
  re-apply on reboot, triggering re-write + verify cycle. The mixed
  approach keeps the existing baked markers valid AND allows new
  Sander-original work to use canonical SNDR prefix without disrupting
  community-tier deployments.
