"""PN373 — parallel_tool_calls null != false (vendor of OPEN vllm#44955).

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired): vllm#44955 MERGED 2026-06-15; the
``is not False`` semantic fix and the merged docstring are native in
pristine dev748 ``tool_calls_utils.py:22-24`` — byte-identical to this
patch's 1-line fix (deep-diff outcome (a)). The Genesis extras (streaming
regression test, pristine bug repro, drift-marker hygiene suite) are
repo-side tests and keep their value. Kept for reference.

Upstream bug (vllm#44948): ``ChatCompletionRequest.parallel_tool_calls``
is declared ``bool | None = True`` (pristine
``entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/protocol.py:233`` on pin
0.22.1rc1.dev259+g303916e93), so a client sending an explicit JSON
``null`` arrives at ``maybe_filter_parallel_tool_calls`` as ``None``.
The pristine truthiness check::

    if request.parallel_tool_calls:
        return choice

treats ``None`` like ``False`` and falls through to the trim branch —
silently truncating multi-tool responses to a SINGLE call on both the
streaming path (``delta.tool_calls`` filtered to ``index == 0``,
serving.py:844) and the non-streaming path (``message.tool_calls[:1]``,
serving.py:1277). The OpenAI-documented default is ``true``, so an
explicit ``null`` must behave like the default: keep all tool calls.

Genesis impact: LiteLLM- and n8n-class clients serialize
``"parallel_tool_calls": null`` when the caller leaves the knob unset.
On our agent workloads (Qwen3.6 PROD / Gemma-4 PRODs) every truncated
parallel tool call costs a full extra agent round-trip (hundreds of ms
to seconds). PN373 vendors #44955's 1-line semantic fix
(``is not False``) and ADDS the streaming-delta unit test the upstream
PR lacks (tests/unit/integrations/serving/
test_pn373_parallel_toolcalls_null.py).

Anchor strategy
---------------
Single sub-patch in ``entrypoints/serve/utils/tool_calls_utils.py``
spanning the function docstring + the truthiness check (byte-verified
count==1 against /private/tmp/candidate_pin_current on 2026-06-11).
The file has exactly one other code path (the trim branch), left
untouched — explicit ``False`` keeps its documented trim behavior.
Anchor overlap: NONE with PN288/P107 (they patch
``entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py``; PN373 patches the
helper module the serving call sites delegate to).

Drift marker: the post-#44955 docstring wording (``parallel_tool_calls
is explicitly False``). It is a byte-substring of the PR's post-image
(gh pr diff 44955, fetched 2026-06-11) and deliberately NOT a substring
of anything PN373 writes (self-collision lint,
tools/lint_drift_markers.py). The merged CONDITION text cannot serve as
a marker — our replacement necessarily emits it. If upstream lands a
reworded variant of the fix, the anchor scan misses and PN373 skips
with anchor-drift instead — equally safe, just a less specific reason.

Gates
-----
  * ``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN373_PARALLEL_TOOLCALLS_NULL`` — install gate,
    default OFF (opt-in; candidate default-on after fleet test). The
    dispatcher consults ``should_apply("PN373")`` against the registry
    BEFORE importing this module (sndr/apply/orchestrator.py
    data-driven dispatch), so ``apply()`` does not duplicate the gate
    (PN367 convention).
