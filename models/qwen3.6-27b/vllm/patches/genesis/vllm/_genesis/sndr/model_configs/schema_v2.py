"""Layered model_config V2 schema (PROJECT_ROADMAP_V2, Phase 1).

Four orthogonal layers compose into a runtime `ModelConfig` (V1 shape):

  • ModelDef         — identity + capabilities + canonical patches set
  • HardwareDef      — rig + sizing knobs + runtime block (docker/podman/bare)
  • ProfileDef       — patches delta (test → promote workflow)
  • PatchManifest    — community plugin metadata (per-patch, lives next to plugin code)

Composition is driven by `compose.py`. Each layer owns specific fields;
cross-layer conflicts on owned fields raise SchemaError at load time
(Q1 decision: ownership-based merge, not override-based).

Backwards compatibility: composed result is a V1 `ModelConfig`, so the
existing runtime (`CompatibilityMatrix`, launch, k8s/compose/quadlet
renderers, tests) continues working without changes.

See `docs/_internal/PROJECT_ROADMAP_V2_2026-05-12_RU.md` § 4 for the full
finalized architecture and Q1-Q7 operator decisions.

    weight bytes, recurrent-state bytes, and activation peak — the numbers
    the ``sndr kv-calc`` command and the preflight "projected VRAM" row need.

    Owns: patches_delta, optional sizing tweaks (operator tuning for the
    (model × hardware) pair), optional version overrides. Does NOT touch
    identity / capabilities — those are model-owned.

    Lifecycle: experimental → validated → promoted (delta merged into model).

    Why sizing_override here (not in hardware): sizing knobs depend on the
    SPECIFIC model on a specific rig (35B on 2×A5000 → max_num_seqs=2;
    27B on same rig → max_num_seqs=4). Profile is the right "operator
    tuning" layer; hardware just declares physical capacity.

    Runtime-role fields (P1.1, 2026-05-20)
    -------------------------------------
    The optional fields below extend ProfileDef from "tuning preset" to
    "runtime role". A profile with ``role=None`` (the default) behaves
    exactly as the prior 17 builtin profiles do — patches_delta +
    sizing_override only. A profile with ``role`` set additionally
    declares spec-decode / compression / backend / routing / validation
    semantics that the composer renders into the launcher env.

    Why optional: all 17 existing builtin profiles set role=None
    implicitly (the field is absent in their YAMLs) and continue to
    work unchanged. See SNDR_RUNTIME_PROFILES_DESIGN_DECISIONS_2026-05-20
    §4 for the full design.

    The ``spec_decode_override`` field reuses V1 ``SpecDecodeConfig``
    rather than introducing a dedicated dataclass — it's literally a
    profile-side spec-decode config (method, K, drafter, sample rules)
    so the V1 type is the right shape and gives single-source-of-truth
    semantics.
