"""SNDR Core dispatcher — PATCH_REGISTRY data (single source of truth).

This file is DATA-ONLY. It exceeds the 300-LOC cap on logic files
because it's a registry of all known patches with their metadata
(2000+ lines of dict entries). The cap exemption was approved by
Sander on 2026-05-07 (Idea 2 of Stage 2 acceptance) — data files
that grow with the patch count are not covered by the structural
LOC limit. Logic files MUST stay under 300 LOC.

Each entry declares:
  - title: short human-readable description
  - env_flag: env var that toggles this patch (without prefix; the
    SNDR_ENABLE_/GENESIS_ENABLE_ prefix is added at lookup time)
  - default_on: bool — whether the patch applies without explicit env
  - category: family bucket (deprecated by Stage 6 family taxonomy)
  - tier: "community" | "engine"  (added at Stage 5)
  - lifecycle: "active" | "deprecated" | "retired" | "legacy"
  - credit: provenance + design notes
  - upstream_pr: int | None (vllm-project/vllm PR number, if applicable)
  - applies_to: dict of profile-key → allowed values (model_class etc.)
  - requires_patches / conflicts_with: dependency declarations
  - composes_with: informational soft-link to related patches
  - apply_module: dotted path to the module providing apply()
    (added at Stage 6 reorg)

Migration history:
  - Original location: vllm/_genesis/dispatcher.py (2828-LOC monolith).
  - Stage 3 (CURRENT): split out as data-only module here.

# ─── DO-NOT-VENDOR notes (negative-space provenance) ────────────────────────
# Decisions to DELIBERATELY NOT vendor an upstream PR, kept next to the
# affected arch handling so a future agent doing a PR sweep does not "re-find"
# the PR and vendor it. (See also the qwen3_5 arch entries below, e.g. the
# Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration model_arch lists on PN128/PN130 etc.)
#
# vllm#46297 — DO NOT vendor (investigated 2026-06-25, dev424).
#   The Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration -> qwen3_5 arch mapping is already
#   NATIVE in dev424 and is the BETTER (dedicated qwen3_5 impl) version:
#   VERIFIED in-container on vllm/vllm-openai:nightly that
#   ModelRegistry maps both Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration AND
#   Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration -> ('qwen3_5', ...) and the MTP heads
#   Qwen3_5MoeMTP/Qwen3_5MTP -> ('qwen3_5_mtp', ...) (the self-MTP + GDN path).
#   PR 46297 would REMAP Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration onto the generic
#   qwen3_moe impl — vendoring it would OVERWRITE the dedicated qwen3_5 impl
#   and break self-MTP/GDN plus the 6 Genesis patches that key on the qwen3_5 /
#   qwen3_5_moe / qwen3_5_mtp arch (PN348 backbone-dedup, PN357 draft-greedy,
#   PN380 prefused-expert loader, PN365 GDN qkvz|ba fuse, PN77 fp8 lm_head,
#   PN61 qwen3_vl KeyError guard). Genesis RELIES ON and PROTECTS the native
#   mapping — there is no Genesis patch and must be none that re-routes
#   Qwen3_5Moe* to qwen3_moe.
#
# ─── Patch metadata registry ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each patch declares what it touches + which env flag enables/disables it.

On NVIDIA GPUs this regressed SYMMETRIC (is_sym=True) AutoRound/GPTQ Marlin MoE: the method then passes the meaningless w13_qzeros/w2_qzeros to the Marlin kernel -> INCORRECT expert outputs. Our 27B = Qwen3.6-27B-int4-AutoRound is CONFIRMED on this path (live checkpoint config.json: quant_method=auto-round, sym=True, bits=4, group_size=128, packing auto_round:auto_gptq -> AutoGPTQMoEMethod) on 2x A5000. Fix vllm#45656 ('Restore is_sym guard for zp in GPTQ/CT MoE', merged 06-18 16:20Z) landed ~12h AFTER the dev148 base commit -> NOT in pin. PN400 backports the auto_gptq.py half: gate w1_zp/w2_zp on `not is_sym` before the gptq_marlin_moe_quant_config return. The upstream `or backend==CPU` clause is intentionally dropped (NVIDIA-only rig; avoids the WNA16MoEBackend import + a NameError-if-half-applied surface). The compressed-tensors twin (file 2 of #45656) is a different checkpoint format we do not run; add PN400B if one enters rotation. Anchor SELF-GATES: the unconditional `w1_zp=getattr(layer,'w13_qzeros',None),` text exists ONLY on pins with #43409 and without #45656 (pre-#43409 / post-#45656 it is `... if <cond> else None` -> self-skip). lifecycle=experimental: the text transform is unit-tested (dev148-broken -> fixed) but the semantic 27B greedy A/B (dev148 vs +PN400) is operator-gated (displaces the 35B PROD).",

Fix: wrap `vllm.config.utils.replace` to detect VllmConfig sources whose compilation_config has `max != max(sizes)` and inject an aligned compilation_config before delegating to the original replace. Narrow scope: only fires when sizes/max are present, inconsistent, and caller doesn't supply compilation_config kwarg explicitly. Does NOT change P95's contract; does NOT touch any ModelDef pin.

# ─── Legacy-register patch index (Entry 17 §6.8 P-2 documentation) ────
# `_apply_module_overlay.APPLY_MODULE_OVERLAY` is the index of 127
# patches that today still live in the monolithic
# `sndr/apply/_per_patch_dispatch.py`. The patches-prove gate
# (§6.8 rule P-2) consults `apply._state.PATCH_REGISTRY` for legacy
# register membership — Phase 10 migration moves each patch into
# `integrations/<family>/<patch>.py`, and the integration-tree walk in
# `dispatcher.spec._build_apply_module_map` picks up the new home
# automatically.
#
# IMPORTANT: this index is NOT applied to PATCH_REGISTRY entries. The
# spec-loop dry-run requires a callable `apply()` in the resolved
# module, which `_per_patch_dispatch.py` doesn't expose (it has 95
# `apply_patch_X` functions, not a generic apply). Writing the overlay
# into PATCH_REGISTRY would mislead the spec-loop into trying to import
# a non-existent `apply()`. Keeping the index file as documentation
# avoids that pitfall while still letting `discover_apply_modules.py`
# track migration progress.
