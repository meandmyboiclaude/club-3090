"""Wiring for Patch PN110 — BlockPool.free_blocks deduplication.

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired, cap kept <0.23.0): the free_blocks
region PN110 anchored on is GONE on pristine dev748 (LRU-split rewrite; the
per-block ``if block.ref_cnt == 0`` append-guard structurally prevents the
double-append symptom). Superseded on the whole >=0.23.0 pin set; still applies
on a <0.23.0 rollback pin via explicit YAML enable.

Backport of [vllm#42615](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/42615)
by `AkCodes23` (OPEN at the time of backport).

================================================================
WHAT THIS PATCH DOES
================================================================

``BlockPool.free_blocks(ordered_blocks)`` currently does::

    blocks_list = list(ordered_blocks)
    for block in blocks_list:
        block.ref_cnt -= 1
    self.free_block_queue.append_n(blocks_list)

If a caller passes the same ``KVCacheBlock`` more than once — which
happens at boundaries between sliding-window attention reuse and
prefix-cache eviction — ``ref_cnt`` decreases twice and the same
block is appended to the free queue twice. The next allocation pops a
block whose ``ref_cnt`` is already negative, which trips the
``fake_free_list_tail`` sentinel assertion (and, in release builds
where the assert is compiled out, leaves a poisoned block in
circulation).

The fix is to deduplicate by object identity (``id(block)``) before
both the ref-count decrement and the queue append, and to emit a
``logger.warning`` when duplicates are seen so the underlying caller
bug stays visible.

================================================================
RELEVANCE FOR GENESIS
================================================================

Our PN95 / PN96 / PN97 stack already wraps ``BlockPool`` (the tier-
aware cache + emergency-demote + physical-cap overlays manipulate
``free_block_queue`` and ``ref_cnt`` near this exact code path). A
caller-side regression in our own overlays could in principle hit the
same double-free as the upstream-reported case — making this a
defensive guard that *composes* with the rest of the family.

Hot reproducer in the upstream PR was sliding-window + a
``SimpleCPUOffloading`` connector; we do not use that connector, but
hybrid GDN attention also uses sliding-window-like block reuse on
27B-INT4, so the latent bug class exists in our stack.

Default ON. Cost is one ``set`` per ``free_blocks`` call (linear in
the input size) — negligible compared to the GPU work the same call
ultimately triggers.

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- Behaviour-preserving for non-duplicate inputs (the only path
  exercised by clean callers).
- Idempotent via Genesis marker comment.
- Drift-marker watches the canonical upstream form so the patch
  self-skips when the fix lands in our pin.
- Adds zero VRAM, no new allocations beyond the per-call dedup set.

================================================================
