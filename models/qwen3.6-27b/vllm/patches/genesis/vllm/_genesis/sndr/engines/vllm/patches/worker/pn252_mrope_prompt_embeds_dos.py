"""Wiring for Patch N252 — M-RoPE prompt_embeds-only DoS fix.

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired): vllm#45252 MERGED 2026-06-13
(GHSA-33cg-gxv8-3p8g) and the engine-native fix predates every live pin
(verified at dev148 2026-06-19; pristine dev748 carries the further-evolved
passthrough-modality form of ``_init_mrope_positions`` with no fatal
assert). The DoS is closed BY THE ENGINE; the patch only auto-applied on
<0.23.0 rollback pins, none of which remain. Kept for reference.

================================================================
Issue (security — GHSA-33cg-gxv8-3p8g)
================================================================

`GpuModelRunner._init_mrope_positions` asserts that the request carries
prompt token IDs::

    assert req_state.prompt_token_ids is not None, (
        "M-RoPE requires prompt_token_ids to be available."
    )

On any M-RoPE model (Qwen2.5-VL, Qwen3-VL, and — directly relevant to
our PROD fleet — Gemma-4 26B-A4B / 31B-AWQ, which are M-RoPE and accept
`prompt_embeds`), a single `/v1/completions` request with
`prompt_embeds` set and `prompt=None` trips this assertion. An
AssertionError raised on the EngineCore execution path is unrecoverable:
the engine dies and the server stops serving every client. One crafted,
*unprivileged* request is a remote denial-of-service.

This is a host-side Python assertion — it fires identically on every GPU
generation (Ampere A5000, Ada, Hopper, Blackwell 5090). There is nothing
arch-specific to gate; the fix is a universal correctness/security guard.

================================================================
Fix (adapted from vllm#45252 / advisory GHSA-33cg-gxv8-3p8g)
================================================================

Two surgical edits to `v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py::_init_mrope_positions`:

1. Drop the fatal `assert prompt_token_ids is not None` (keep the
   legitimate `assert supports_mrope(model)` and the `cast`).
2. At the call site, derive a *non-None* token sequence before calling
   `get_mrope_input_positions`:
     - real `prompt_token_ids` when present;
     - else dummy positional IDs `range(prompt_embeds.shape[0])` — M-RoPE
       only needs the sequence LENGTH for a passthrough modality without
       `grid_thw` (the values are placeholders; `mrope_features` already
       has the `prompt_embeds` modality filtered out so it carries no
       grids). The existing in-tree comment says as much: "prompt_embeds
       positions are treated as text positions for M-RoPE";
     - else, when BOTH are absent, a clean `ValueError`. Unlike the
       assert, a `ValueError` is surfaced as a per-request error and does
       NOT crash the engine.

How this improves on a verbatim upstream copy:
  - Integrated into the Genesis dispatcher (`should_apply`), idempotency
    marker, and build-time anchor manifest — survives the entrypoint
    `exec vllm serve` pattern and warm restarts.
  - All-or-nothing: both edits are `required=True` in one TextPatcher, so
    a half-applied state (assert removed but call site still passing a
    possibly-None `prompt_token_ids`) can never be written — the patcher
    returns SKIPPED and leaves the file pristine.
  - Documents the security context (GHSA) inline for future maintainers.

================================================================
PIN STATE (verified 2026-06-14, both pins live)
================================================================

The vulnerable function is **byte-identical** on both pins in our window:
  - dev259 (`0.22.1rc1.dev259+g303916e93`, current PROD) — `_init_mrope_positions`
  - dev491 (`0.22.1rc1.dev491+g1033ffac2`, promotion candidate)
Both still carry the fatal assert; the upstream merge of #45252 had NOT
landed in either nightly tag. So a single byte-exact anchor applies to
both — no dual-anchor split needed. When a future pin merges the fix, the
anchor (which includes the assert) stops matching and the patch self-skips
(`required_anchor_missing` → SKIPPED), leaving the merged code untouched.

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- `applies_to: {}` — the patch text is installed unconditionally, but the
  patched code path is reached ONLY for M-RoPE models (`assert
  supports_mrope(model)` guards entry). On a non-M-RoPE model the edited
  lines are never executed; zero behavioral change.
- `default_on=True` is informational under the strict-opt-in dispatcher
  (Sander directive 2026-05-17): the security fix is *recommended* on, and
  the launcher engages it via `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN252_MROPE_PROMPT_EMBEDS_DOS=1`.
  Operators can A/B with `GENESIS_DISABLE_PN252_MROPE_PROMPT_EMBEDS_DOS=1`.
- Worst case on a happy-path request (prompt_token_ids present): the new
  `if` takes the first branch → identical behavior to the original code.
