"""PN370 — vendor OPEN PR vllm#45100 (async spec-decode accepted-counts race).

RETIRED 2026-07-05 (lifecycle: retired): vllm#45100 MERGED 2026-06-22 and is
native in both live pins (deep-diff receipts on the PN398 twin, retired the
same day). This 0.22.x vendor variant was already version-gated off on every
0.23.x pin (range <0.23.0). Kept for reference.

Two sub-fixes from the same upstream PR, vendored against pin
0.22.1rc1.dev259+g303916e93 (anchors byte-verified count==1 on the
pristine tree):

1. ``v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`` ``_prepare_inputs`` — SKIP the CPU
   accepted-counts read under async scheduling on the non-align mamba
   path. ``_update_states_after_model_execute`` writes the counts to
   ``input_batch.num_accepted_tokens_cpu_tensor`` with a NON-BLOCKING
   D2H copy; under async scheduling the next ``_prepare_inputs`` may
   also remap request rows after ``input_batch.swap_states()`` /
   ``condense()``. At a request's prefill-to-first-spec-decode
   transition GDN can therefore consume ANOTHER ROW's accepted-token
   count (e.g. 4 instead of 1) and restore the recurrent state from the
   wrong speculative state slot — for Qwen3.5/3.6 hybrids this loses
   prompt memory and the request ends quickly with garbled text + EOS
   (upstream repro: 16/20480 generations corrupted unpatched, 0/20480
   patched; Qwen3.5-27B MTP=3 + async + FULL_AND_PIECEWISE). The fix
   stays device-authoritative: counts default to 1 and the existing GPU
   correction kernel (``update_num_computed_tokens_for_batch_change``
   consuming ``valid_sampled_token_count``) overwrites the
   draft-participating rows. Align-mode (``mamba_cache_mode ==
   "align"``) keeps the synchronized CPU path because its preprocessing
   consumes CPU-side counts. BONUS: on the skipped path the per-step
   ``num_accepted_tokens_event.synchronize()`` + NumPy gather +
   ``copy_to_gpu()`` are gone (the upstream A/B shows ~1.2% tok/s and
   the roadmap estimates ~2-5% TPOT on our 35B PROD shape).

2. ``v1/attention/backends/gdn_attn.py`` ``build()`` — size the FULL
   cudagraph per-request metadata views by ``m.num_reqs`` instead of
   the token-padded ``m.num_actual_tokens``. The slices fed to
   ``GDNAttentionMetadata`` (``spec_state_indices_tensor``,
   ``spec_sequence_masks``, ``spec_query_start_loc``,
   ``num_accepted_tokens``, and the non-spec decode views) are indexed
   by REQUEST; padding them to the token budget (num_reqs * (K+1) under
   MTP K) hands the kernel oversized garbage rows.

Upstream did NOT vendor: the comment-only hunk inside the ``else:``
branch of the same region (zero behavior; the contract is documented
here and in the replacement comments instead — iron rule #10: adapt,
don't blind-copy).

================================================================
COMPOSITION WITH PN341 (MANDATORY — identical anchor line)
================================================================

PN341 sub-patch 4 (``pn341_mtp_decode_bubbles_gpu_runner.py``,
``PN341_PREPARE_OLD``) anchors the IDENTICAL pristine
``_prepare_inputs`` block (the ``if self.num_accepted_tokens_event is
not None:`` site). PN370 composes via the established chain convention
(PN32-imports-PN79 / PN365-imports-PN50 precedent):

- PN370 carries TWO runner anchor variants with required-at-least-one
  semantics (both ``required=False``; the TextPatcher kernel returns
  SKIPPED ``no_applicable_sub_patches`` when every sub-patch misses):

  * pristine-shaped variant (``PN370_PREPARE_PRISTINE_OLD`` ==
    PN341's ``PN341_PREPARE_OLD`` — byte-equality asserted in tests) —
    matches an untouched pristine file (PN341 disabled);
  * post-PN341-shaped variant (``PN370_PREPARE_POST_PN341_OLD`` IS
    PN341's own ``PN341_PREPARE_NEW`` constant, imported — the two
    modules cannot silently diverge). The replacement keeps PN341's
    GPU-only branch byte-identical and only re-gates the trailing
    ``elif`` (the event-backed CPU path) on NOT (async and non-align).

- APPLY-ORDER: PN341 dispatches BEFORE PN370 (boot dispatch parking
  lot: PN341 block precedes PN370's in
  ``sndr/apply/_per_patch_dispatch.py``; keep the registry entry after
  PN341's for SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS parity). The REVERSE order still
  yields valid Python: PN370's pristine variant fires, then PN341's
  sub-patch 4 soft-skips (required=False) while its other three subs
  apply. Roadmap verdict: soft-skip acceptable — under async
  scheduling PN370's gate already routes to the device-authoritative
  default. CAVEAT (documented, not PROD-reachable): in that reverse
  order with async scheduling OFF + hybrid + MTP, PN341's producer-side
  early return loses its consumer (sub-patch 4) — run PN341 first, as
  the dispatch order does.

- PN290 composes cleanly: producer side
  (``_update_states_after_model_execute`` D2H copy) vs PN370's consumer
  side (``_prepare_inputs``) — disjoint anchors, any order.
- PN340 composes cleanly: its three gdn_attn.py anchors (init arange
  buffer / build spec-token indexing / copy gating) are disjoint from
  the ``batch_size`` line.

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- Opt-in: ``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN370_ASYNC_ACCEPT_RACE=1`` (default OFF).
- Runner variants are required=False (at-least-one); the GDN anchor is
  required=True — a half-missing GDN anchor SKIPs loudly instead of
  silently shipping a partial vendor (PN286/PN290 half-apply lesson).
- Drift markers watch the merged form of vllm#45100:
  ``needs_cpu_accepted_counts`` (the variable the PR introduces; our
  emitted text deliberately uses ``_pn370_read_cpu_accepted_counts`` to
  stay disjoint — lint_drift_markers contract) and the PR's
  ``token-padded for FULL graph replay`` comment in gdn_attn.py.
- Behavior change is gated at RUNTIME by upstream's own condition
  (``use_async_scheduling`` and non-align) — on sync-scheduling or
  align-mode deployments the patched file is behavior-identical to
  pristine.

Expected effect (preserve BOTH): eliminates the silent-corruption class
on async + MTP hybrids (our exact 35B PROD config: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B FP8,
hybrid GDN + MoE, MTP K=3, async-scheduling ON) AND ~2-5% TPOT from the
deleted per-step synchronize.
