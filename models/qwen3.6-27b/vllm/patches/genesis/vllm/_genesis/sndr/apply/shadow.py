"""SNDR Core apply — shadow comparison: PatchSpec-driven order vs legacy.

PR38 Day 5 (2026-05-08): before flipping `orchestrator.run()` to use
`PatchSpec.apply_module` directly (Day 6-8), surface differences
between the two apply orders so operators can audit them off-line.

Two sources of order:

  1. **Legacy** — `apply._state.PATCH_REGISTRY` (list of (name, fn)),
     populated by `@register_patch` decorators in `_per_patch_dispatch.py`.
     This is the order Genesis has been running for years.

  2. **Spec-driven** — `dispatcher.iter_patch_specs()` yields a PatchSpec
     per `dispatcher.PATCH_REGISTRY` entry. Order today is registry
     dict-iteration order.

`compare_apply_orders()` returns a structured diff:

  - `legacy_only`: registered fn names with no PatchSpec match
  - `spec_only`: PatchSpec patch_ids with no legacy fn match
  - `legacy_count` / `spec_count`: total per-source counts
  - `coverage_pct`: fraction of spec-driven patches that have an
                    `apply_module` (i.e. could actually run via the
                    new dispatch loop)

CLI:

    python -m sndr.apply.shadow

# ─── Known divergent patches (P1-1 audit closure 2026-05-08) ─────────────
#
# Patches intentionally listed only in `dispatcher.PATCH_REGISTRY` and
# not in the legacy `_per_patch_dispatch.py` registry. Two reasons:
#
#   (a) registry-only documentation entries with no `apply_module`
#       — legacy ledger rows for retired/preflight/research patches
#       that don't have a runtime apply path. Adding @register_patch
#       for them would create a dummy dispatcher with no behavior.
#
#   (b) spec-only patches with `apply_module` set — these are the
#       direction the migration is going (registry as single source
#       of truth). Adding them to the legacy parking-lot module would
#       defeat the migration. Listed here so CI gate doesn't false-
#       positive on the intentional gap.
#
# Any new spec_only patch NOT in this set will surface as
# `unexpected_spec_only` and fail `--strict` mode. To add an entry
# here, the patch must either (a) lack an apply_module on purpose, or
# (b) be reviewed and confirmed as a registry-driven-only addition.
