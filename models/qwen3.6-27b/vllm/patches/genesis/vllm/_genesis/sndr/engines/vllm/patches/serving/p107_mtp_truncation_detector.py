"""Wiring for P107 — vllm#41467 backport: MTP truncation detector.

With MTP K>=1 + tools + reasoning parser there is a rare (~0.25% per
author measurement on Qwen3.6-27B-FP8) condition: the model emits EOS
at the reasoning->tool_call boundary. finish_reason=stop + tools
configured + neither tool_calls nor content delivered → silent
client-side error.

Fix: defensive guard in `chat_completion_stream_generator` that
detects this combo and raises GenerationError (retryable) instead of
emitting a silent stop. The client receives an SSE error event and
retries.

Directly affects our PROD: 27B Lorbus + MTP K=3 + tools — exactly
the config the author reported. P107 is a safety net on top of an
already-defended path (P59/P60/P61/P62/P64/P68/P69 family).

Default OFF — defensive backport. Risk: low; adds one extra branch
in the hot path, no effect on the happy path.

# the ``auto_tools_called`` OR-clause from the if-head — live file at
# vllm/entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py:820-826 now reads
# ``if (tools_streamed[i] and ...) or (self.use_harmony and ...):``. The
# v3 (2026-06-11): the v2 comment claiming ``auto_tools_called`` still
# exists in the streaming generator was WRONG — on this pin the variable
# lives only in the NON-streaming full generator (pristine serving.py
# 1069+, streaming generator is 399-1000). The baked v2 text raised a
# live NameError at stream end on every tool-bearing streamed request
# (caught by fleet validation 2026-06-11, predicted by the preflight
# triage). The clause is dropped; ``not tools_streamed[i]`` +
# ``not delta_message.tool_calls`` retain the detector's protection. P107's misleading ``# likely
# upstream merged`` skip-message was wrong (PR #41467 still OPEN); the
# anchor drift was code-shape refactor, not behavioral upstreaming.
# v4 (2026-06-13, dev491 pin bump): this dev259 block is now ONE of two
# mutually-exclusive anchor variants (required=False). It stays byte-stable
# (the validated PROD anchor + the PN288 chain depend on it); the dev491

# ── dev491 anchor variant (pin bump 0.22.1rc1.dev491+g1033ffac2) ────────
# vllm#45171 (merged 2026-06-11) deleted ~74 lines from serving.py and
# moved harmony streaming out to parser/harmony.py — so the dev259 streaming
# finish_reason block CHANGED SHAPE. Verified byte-exact 2026-06-13 against
# BOTH pristine trees:
#   * dev259 (CURRENT PROD, /private/tmp/candidate_pin_current): the if-head
#     is the two-clause ``(tools_streamed[i] and ...) or (self.use_harmony
#     and harmony_tools_streamed[i])`` form — matched by ANCHOR_OLD above
#     (count==1 in dev259 tree, count==0 in dev491 tree).
#   * dev491 (CANDIDATE, /tmp/candidate_pin_new): #45171 DROPPED the harmony
#     OR-clause from the if-head — it is now the single-line
#     ``if tools_streamed[i] and not tool_choice_function_name:`` form
#     (ANCHOR_DEV491_OLD; count==1 in dev491 tree, count==0 in dev259 tree).
# The two anchors are mutually exclusive: exactly one matches per pin under
# the PN351/PN32/P18B required-at-least-one convention (both required=False;
# apply() asserts at least one fired).
#
# Two scope deltas in the dev491 stream generator drive the replacement text:
#   1. ``reasoning_parser`` is NOT a local here. dev491 uses a single unified
#      ``parser`` (serving.py:575 ``parser.parse_delta(...)``) that subsumes
#      reasoning + tool parsing; the old per-name ``reasoning_parser`` local
#      no longer exists in this generator — referencing it would raise
#      NameError at stream end (the exact dev259-v2 class of bug). The
#      equivalent guard is ``parser is not None`` (a parser is configured and
#      thus reasoning/tool extraction is active but produced nothing).
#   2. ``GenerationError`` is already imported at MODULE level on dev491
#      (serving.py:46 ``from vllm.entrypoints.openai.engine.serving import
#      GenerationError``) AND the whole streaming loop is wrapped in
#      ``try ... except GenerationError`` (serving.py:780) which converts it
#      to a retryable SSE error via
#      ``_convert_generation_error_to_streaming_response``. So the dev491
#      variant raises the module-level ``GenerationError`` directly — no
#      fragile local import (the dev259 variant's local import targets
#      ``chat_completion.protocol`` which does NOT export GenerationError;
#      that latent ImportError never fires only because the detector is
#      default-OFF — left untouched here to keep the validated dev259 anchor
#      byte-stable).
#
# PN288 chain: PN288 (CHAINED_ANCHOR on P107 per preflight) re-applies the
# bare finish_reason block shifted +4 inside its except-fallback. P107's
# dev491 ANCHOR_DEV491_NEW preserves that bare block verbatim and the emitted
# warning/raise text is IDENTICAL to the dev259 variant — so PN288's
# (separately re-anchored) dev491 streaming anchor still resolves exactly
# once against P107's output.
