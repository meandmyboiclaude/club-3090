"""Wiring for Patch PN119 — TurboQuant k8v4 GQA head grouping kernel.

Backport of [vllm#40792](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40792)
by `hoseung2` (OPEN at the time of backport).

================================================================
WHAT THIS PATCH DOES
================================================================

Adds the GQA-grouped variant of TurboQuant decode stage-1 kernel
``_tq_grouped_decode_stage1`` (~260 lines of new Triton code) and
updates the dispatch in ``triton_turboquant_decode_attention`` to
select the grouped kernel when GQA is active. The grouped kernel
handles BOTH FP8 keys (k8v4) and MSE-quantized keys (FIX 2 — the
Gemma ``turboquant_4bit_nc`` preset, ``key_fp8=False``); both route
through ``tl.dot`` tensor cores. The gate is
``kv_group_size > 1 and value_quant_bits == 4`` (3-bit-value presets
still fall back to the scalar kernel).

The upstream PR measured **+16.5% – 27.2% TPS** on A100 / H100 with
GQA-ratio ∈ {4, 8, 24}. Our 27B and 35B both run **GQA-ratio 8**
(num_q_heads=32, num_kv_heads=4) so the win should be near the high
end on Ampere SM 8.6 hardware.

The grouped kernel:
  - Loads K once per ``BLOCK_H`` query-head tile and shares it across
    that whole tile of q-heads (the q-heads of one GQA group all read
    the same K vectors).
  - Uses ``tl.dot`` instead of element-wise products → routes through
    tensor cores instead of CUDA cores → 4-8× FLOPS density.
  - For MSE-quantized keys (``key_fp8=False``), reconstructs the same
    ``k_float = vec_norms * centroids`` tile the scalar kernel implies
    (FIX 2), so the dot product is numerically equivalent to the
    scalar ``scores = vec_norms * sum(q_rot * c) * scale``.
  - Falls back to the legacy ``_tq_decode_stage1`` kernel only for
    presets the grouped V-path cannot handle (3-bit values).

================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
================================================================

The kernel diff is +201 / -8 lines in
``vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_turboquant_decode.py``, split across
two hunks: insertion of the new kernel after ``_tq_decode_stage1``,
and dispatch refactor in ``triton_turboquant_decode_attention``.

Both hunks are too large for inline anchor strings to be stable. We
bundle the upstream diff (``pn119_kernel.diff`` sibling file) and
apply it via ``subprocess`` (``patch -p4`` with filename rewriting).
A pre-patch md5 guard prevents application against drifted code; if
the file has changed in upstream relative to our cached diff, we
self-skip (safe — no partial application).

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

- **md5 pre-patch guard**: if current file md5 != expected pre-patch
  md5, the diff was authored against different code → skip.
- **Idempotency**: a marker line is injected at file head right after
  apply. On subsequent boots we check the marker before attempting
  re-patch.
- **Drift retreat**: when upstream merges (or rewrites) the kernel,
  our md5 guard catches it and PN119 self-retires.
- **No fallback path needed**: PN119 is additive on top of an
  unchanged dispatch entry point. If the patch fails to apply,
  vLLM continues with the original scalar kernel.

================================================================
HW GATE
================================================================

This patch is *active* on Ampere (SM 8.x) and Hopper (SM 9.x). It is
*not* expected to crash on newer HW, but the win was only measured
on A100/H100. Operators may disable with ``GENESIS_DISABLE_PN119=1``.
