"""Consolidated wiring for P64 + P61c + PN56 — all three text-patch the SAME
engine file ``tool_parsers/qwen3coder_tool_parser.py`` at DISJOINT regions
(P64 ALSO has a second, 0-match-on-pristine target ``serving.py``).

RETIRED 2026-07-03 (lifecycle: retired, capped <0.23.0): superseded by the
upstream streaming parser-engine refactor vllm#45413/#45171/#45588 (MERGED
2026-06-15), which DELETED ``tool_parsers/qwen3coder_tool_parser.py`` — the
engine-native qwen3 tool adapter owns streaming coalescing + deferred-commit on
0.23.x. Target file gone on the deployed pin (verified live dev714 2026-07-03)
and the rollback pin dev672, so all three subs are inert across the ≤2-pin set.
Kept for reference / pins <0.23.0.

================================================================
WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (maintainability refactor, 2026-06-20)
================================================================

P64 (qwen3coder MTP streaming early-return fix, vllm#39598), P61c
(qwen3coder deferred-commit until <function= header, club-3090#72) and
PN56 (qwen3coder XML parse fallback, vllm#41466) historically lived in
three separate wiring modules, each with its own ``TextPatcher`` and its
own ``# [Genesis wiring marker: ...]`` line, even though they patch the
same parser file at non-overlapping anchors:

  - P64  → ``qwen3coder_tool_parser.py``: remove early-return +
           unify </function> emit (TWO sub-patches). PLUS a SECOND target
           ``entrypoints/openai/chat_completion/serving.py`` carrying two
           ``required=False`` sub-patches (safety-net widen + call-site
           guard) that are RETIRED-by-design on dev259+ and 0-match a
           pristine tree (the helper they anchored on was refactored out;
           P107 carries the serving-side role now — journal 2026-06-09).
  - P61c → the commit-trigger block at the top of
           ``extract_tool_calls_streaming``. ONE sub-patch.
  - PN56 → the ``_parse_xml_function_call`` try/except parse-success
           tracking + fallback restore. ONE sub-patch.

This module collapses all three into ONE registry entry (id ``P64``, the
coder primary) with ONE ``apply_module``. P64 is the primary (co-enabled
everywhere); P61c's and PN56's enable flags become ``env_flag_aliases`` on
the merged entry so their existing YAML opt-ins keep engaging the merged
module.

================================================================
DESIGN: SEPARATE TextPatchers PER absorbed patch, EACH WITH ITS OWN MARKER
================================================================

Unlike the chunk_o (PN29+PN298) and rejection_sampler (P71+PN369)
precedents — which build ONE ``TextPatcher`` with all sub-patches and one
shared marker — this cluster keeps one ``TextPatcher`` PER absorbed patch
(P64 keeps its TWO patchers: qwen3coder + serving). Two engine facts force
this:

  1. FAILURE ISOLATION. ``TextPatcher._apply_layer5_legacy`` returns
     SKIPPED for the WHOLE patcher on the FIRST ``required=True`` anchor
     miss (text_patch.py ~524). Merging all three into one patcher would
     mean a P64 anchor drift also skips P61c's and PN56's sub-patches.

  2. NO SHARED-MARKER CROSS-SHADOWING. ``TextPatcher.apply`` Layer 2
     (text_patch.py ~345) returns IDEMPOTENT the instant ``self.marker``
     is in the file, BEFORE applying any sub-patch. If the separate
     patchers shared one marker, patcher #1 would prepend it and the rest
     would no-op their anchors. So each carries a DISTINCT marker — reused
     verbatim from each absorbed patch's ORIGINAL module.

CONSEQUENCE FOR BYTE-EQUIVALENCE (marker carve-out): ``TextPatcher.apply``
prepends one ``# [Genesis wiring marker: <marker>]`` line per successful
patcher (text_patch.py ~435). Keeping the original distinct markers, the
merged module emits the SAME marker lines on each touched file as running
the three originals separately, so the applied output is byte-identical to
P64+P61c+PN56 applied separately INCLUDING marker lines — not merely on
the patched code regions. (P64's qwen3coder marker is suffixed
``:: qwen3coder_tool_parser.py`` and its serving marker
``:: serving.py`` exactly as the original module, so each file keeps its
original single marker.) Byte-equivalence is asserted for the patched CODE
regions in any case.

serving.py STAYS BYTE-UNTOUCHED on pristine: P64's two serving sub-patches
are ``required=False`` and 0-match the dev148/dev259 pristine tree, so the
serving patcher returns SKIPPED (no_applicable_sub_patches) and never
prepends a marker — exactly the original P64 behavior. They are kept here
as a distinct patcher so a <0.23.0 rollback pin whose serving.py still
carries the old helper shape would still get them.

================================================================
PER-FEATURE GATING + VERSION-GATE REPLICATION (the critical correction)
================================================================

All three absorbed patches routed through ``should_apply(...)`` and all
three carry ``applies_to.vllm_version_range=(">=0.20.0", "<0.23.0")`` —
the qwen3coder/qwen3xml tool parsers were deleted/remapped by #45171/#45588
in the dev148-era engine, which owns streaming tool-call extraction
natively; these dev259-era wraps fight the native parser and leak tool-call
XML to content on 0.23.x.

``should_apply``'s version-only gate fires BEFORE the env-override branch
(decision.py ~585 vs ~589) and is LIVE on the rig
(``GENESIS_ENFORCE_VERSION_RANGE=1``, hardware yaml:119, composed into both
PROD configs). A naive direct env check inside this module would BYPASS the
version gate and APPLY the wraps on a >=0.23.0 pin where the files are
still present — corrupting the engine-native parser — while the standalone
originals would version-SKIP. So each per-group helper replicates BOTH the
env gate AND the version gate via
``check_version_constraints({"vllm_version_range": (">=0.20.0","<0.23.0")})``
when ``_version_enforcement_on()`` (mirrors p71_pn369's ``_pn369_enabled``).
The merged registry entry ALSO carries the identical range so
``should_apply("P64")`` version-gate-SKIPs the whole module on dev148.
