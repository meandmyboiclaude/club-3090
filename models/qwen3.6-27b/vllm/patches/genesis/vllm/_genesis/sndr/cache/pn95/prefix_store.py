"""PN95 L2 prefix store + demote/promote + execution helpers.

The CPU-side L2 prefix cache is the heart of PN95's tier-aware path:
when vllm evicts a cached GPU block (``_maybe_evict_cached_block``),
``demote_on_evict`` captures the bytes to ``_PN95_PREFIX_STORE``;
when vllm later reads a cache-miss hash (``get_cached_block``),
``promote_on_miss`` restores the bytes from the L2 store (or the
disk tier) into a freshly-allocated GPU block.

Ten helpers split across four concerns:

  Prefix-store accounting:
    _prefix_store_max_bytes         — env-cached GiB cap
    _prefix_store_evict_until_fit   — LRU eviction (with optional
                                       disk-tier spillover)
    _pn95_l1_pool                   — pinned-pool singleton accessor

  Block-pool registration:
    register_block_pool             — record a BlockPool ref for
                                       worker-side proactive demote

  Demote / promote — text-anchor entry points:
    demote_on_evict                 — GPU→L1+L2 capture on eviction
    promote_on_miss                 — L1/L2/disk→GPU restore on miss

  Execution / orchestration (parked here in M.4.2.H — they all call
  demote_on_evict / promote_on_miss):
    pn95_demote_batch               — super-block batched demote
                                       (calls demote_on_evict)
    _proactive_demote_cold          — scheduler-tick proactive path
                                       (calls demote_on_evict via
                                        _select_cold_blocks_via_bpool_lru)
    worker_side_proactive_demote    — worker-process driver
                                       (calls demote_on_evict +
                                        register_block_pool)
    pn95_materialize_virtual_block  — Phase 5 Anchor #12 donor swap
                                       (calls demote_on_evict; reads
                                        _PN95_BLOCK_METADATA virtual-
                                        block side-table)

M.4.2.H scope: function extraction only. State singletons stay in
``_pn95_runtime``:

  _PN95_PREFIX_STORE              — OrderedDict (LRU); test sites
                                     don't rebind, but the legacy
                                     module is the canonical owner
                                     because the disk_tier test (×1
                                     site) does direct
                                     ``rt._PN95_PREFIX_STORE_BYTES_USED = 128``
  _PN95_PREFIX_STORE_BYTES_USED   — int; REBOUND inside
                                     ``_prefix_store_evict_until_fit``
                                     and ``demote_on_evict`` /
                                     ``promote_on_miss``; rebind via
                                     ``_rt.X -= …`` attribute mutation
  _PN95_PREFIX_STORE_MAX_BYTES_CACHED — cached envvar; REBOUND inside
                                     ``_prefix_store_max_bytes``
  _PN95_BLOCK_POOL_REFS           — list (.append in register_block_pool)
  _PN95_PREFIX_STORE_LOCK         — threading.Lock (read-only ref)

The original ``global ... = …`` rebind sites are replicated via
explicit attribute mutation on ``_rt`` (lazy-import inside each body)
at the same module-attribute slot the original ``global`` declaration
mutated.

Sibling-patch text-anchor imports (CRITICAL — preserved via
``_pn95_runtime`` re-export shim, no anchor regen):

  pn95_tier_aware_cache.py:181 / :334 / :342
    ``from sndr.cache._pn95_runtime import register_block_pool
       as _g_pn95_regpool`` (×3)

    ``from sndr.cache._pn95_runtime import promote_on_miss
       as _g_pn95_promote_m``

This file pulls in transfer / compression / demote_policy /
virtual_blocks via gates as needed — no circular import because
those modules already use lazy ``_rt`` access for their own state
references.

    CRITICAL FIX (Phase 4.2): byte reinterpret consistency. Previous version
    used `view.numel()` (element count, dtype-aware) when src is uint8 byte
    buffer — wrong for float16/bfloat16 tensors (numel = bytes/2, but src

    call regression observed at 6/7 vs OFF baseline 7/7).

    Fix: reinterpret BOTH view and src as uint8 byte arrays before copy.
    This is dtype-agnostic and exact for any KV cache layout (TQ k8v4,
    fp8_e5m2, fp16, bf16).

    Returns a KVCacheBlock object (newly allocated, populated from CPU
    bytes, re-inserted into vllm's prefix cache) on hit, or None on miss.

    Safety: get_new_blocks may evict another cached block — that block's
