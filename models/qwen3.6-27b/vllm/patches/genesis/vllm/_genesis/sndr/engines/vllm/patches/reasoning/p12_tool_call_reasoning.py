"""Wiring for Patch 12 — Qwen3 `<tool_call>` as implicit reasoning end.

Problem
-------
Qwen3.5/3.6 models occasionally emit `<tool_call>` INSIDE a `<think>` block
without ever closing the thinking with `</think>`. The vLLM serving layer
uses `is_reasoning_end(input_ids)` to decide when reasoning ended; the
baseline parser only looks for `</think>` so the entire tool invocation
stays trapped as reasoning content, never reaching the serving layer as
a real tool call.

Mirrors upstream PR #35687 (still pending merge at v7.0 baseline).

Fix
---
Three orthogonal additions to `Qwen3ReasoningParser`:

  1. `__init__` — resolve `<tool_call>` / `</tool_call>` tag token IDs via
     the tokenizer vocab (mirrors upstream PR #35687).
  2. Inject `is_reasoning_end(input_ids)` method that walks the input
     tokens backwards and returns True if a lone `<tool_call>` (not paired
     with a later `</tool_call>`) precedes any `</think>`.
  3. Inject `is_reasoning_end_streaming(input_ids, delta_ids)` — returns
     True if the base check fires OR a fresh `<tool_call>` token landed
     in this streaming delta.
  4. Inject `extract_content_ids(input_ids)` — fallback to the token
     slice starting at the last `<tool_call>` when the base class returns
     no content IDs.

Scope note: this intentionally does NOT rewrite `extract_reasoning` or the
streaming tail of the parser. Those rewrites would conflict with Patch 27's
BEFORE-THINK fallback (identical source anchors). Doing only the additive
parts keeps both patches coexistable and gets us the serving-layer hook
— which is the behavioral win. The extract_reasoning rewrite is deferred
until upstream PR #35687 lands.

Platform compatibility: vendor-agnostic — pure Python parser logic.
Model compatibility: Qwen3-family only (DeepSeek-V3 uses different parser).

# NOTE 2026-05-15: removed patcher-level drift markers. Upstream PR #35687
# landed (token-id resolution, is_reasoning_end_streaming, extract_content_ids
# in qwen3_reasoning_parser.py) but used LAST-occurrence semantics in
# extract_content_ids — which silently drops earlier <tool_call> blocks in
# multi-tool agentic flows. Legacy sub-patches now self-skip on upstream
# merge (required=False); the new `p12_last_to_first_occurrence` sub-patch
# applies the FIRST-occurrence flip on top of upstream code.
#
# NOTE 2026-07-03 (live dev714 verification — CLOSED): P12 is correctly
# version-capped out of dev714 (registry applies_to.vllm_version_range
# "<0.23.0") and its FIRST-occurrence fix is SUPERSEDED, not merely inert.
# Upstream #45413 ("Streaming Parser Engine and new Qwen3 Parser", MERGED
# 2026-06-15) DELETED `reasoning/qwen3_reasoning_parser.py` (and
# `tool_parsers/qwen3coder_tool_parser.py`) and rewrote Qwen3 reasoning/tool
# parsing as a config-driven streaming FSM (`vllm/parser/engine/` +
# `parser/qwen3.py`). In that architecture content is NOT sliced on the
# <tool_call> token at all (the base ParserEngine.extract_content_ids keys on
# the </think> reasoning-end token, and the FSM emits a TOOL_CALL_START for
# EVERY <tool_call> block), so the earlier-<tool_call>-block-drop bug P12 fixed
# is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE. Confirmed by two independent live-container
# investigations (parser/qwen3.py has no [::-1].index(tool_call) anywhere; the
# live 35B runs --reasoning-parser qwen3 --tool-call-parser qwen3_xml on the new
# engine). Rollback-safe: the refactor is present on both current (dev714) and
# rollback (dev672) pins. So there is nothing to re-target — the module is kept
# only for pins < 0.23.0 that still ship the old parser. See ADR 0002 and
# scripts/audit_patch_targets_exist.py (the gate that verifies no patch is
# SILENTLY stranded — this one is excused by its version cap).
