"""PN389 — XGrammar input-validation + grammar-compilation timeouts.

Vendor of OPEN vllm#45390 (jperezdealgaba, "fix(security): add input
validation and compilation timeouts for DoS mitigations"; studied via
``gh pr view`` + ``gh pr diff`` 2026-06-13). Backports the seven-GHSA
DoS-hardening bundle, scoped to the XGrammar grammar-compilation hot
path that EVERY Genesis tool-call traverses.

================================================================
0.23.1 REDESIGN (dev491 -> 0.23.1 migration; pin
0.23.1rc1.dev101+g4c6266331)
================================================================

The prose below describes the ORIGINAL 3-file design (introduce our own
``run_with_timeout`` + ``_check_regex_complexity`` in utils.py, a new
``VLLM_GRAMMAR_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` env in envs.py, and a
``compile_grammar -> _compile_ctx -> _compile_ctx_inner`` refactor in
backend_xgrammar.py). On the 0.23.1 pin that design no longer composes:
upstream ALREADY landed a first-generation helper
``compile_regex_with_timeout`` (utils.py; ThreadPoolExecutor +
``future.result(timeout)``, bounded by the env
``VLLM_REGEX_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_S``, default 5s), already imported it
into backend_xgrammar.py, and already wraps the REGEX arm of
``compile_grammar`` with it. The original utils.py / envs.py anchors are
therefore gone (count==0) or redundant, and re-adding our own helper/env
would collide with the upstream ones.

The ACTIVE patch (see the patcher builders + ``_all_patchers`` + the
constants ``PN389_XGR_COMPILE_GRAMMAR_OLD`` / ``..._NEW`` below) is a
single byte-exact edit on backend_xgrammar.py ``compile_grammar`` that
REUSES the already-present ``compile_regex_with_timeout`` to wall-clock-
bound the four arms upstream still leaves unbounded (JSON / JSON_OBJECT /
GRAMMAR / STRUCTURAL_TAG), leaving the REGEX arm exactly as upstream
wrote it. The utils.py / envs.py / frontend-validate sub-patches are
retained as non-required, inert no-ops (NOT wired into the transaction)
for historical reference. Effective budget is now the existing
``VLLM_REGEX_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_S`` (default 5s), not the original 2s
intent — operator-tunable via that env.

================================================================
UPSTREAM BUG CLASS (7 GHSA, CWE-400 uncontrolled resource consumption)
================================================================

The OpenAI-compatible structured-output path compiles a user-supplied
grammar/regex/JSON-schema into a DFA on the CPU engine loop with NO
wall-clock bound. A pathological grammar (catastrophic-backtracking
regex, exponential JSON schema) consumes unbounded CPU during
compilation — and because compilation runs on the single EngineCore
thread, it wedges ALL decode for every concurrent request. Our PROD is
single-instance and single-user-low-latency: async-scheduling overlap
does NOT save us (overlap hides GPU latency behind the scheduler, but
grammar compilation is pure-CPU on the engine loop, off the GPU
stream). One adversarial tool schema therefore stalls the whole engine
indefinitely — an instance-wide DoS.

vllm#45390 closes this with a generic ``run_with_timeout`` (daemon
thread + ``Queue`` hand-off + bounded ``Semaphore`` so timed-out
compilations cannot accumulate) wrapping every XGrammar entrypoint, plus
a cheap ``_check_regex_complexity`` pre-filter (length + paren-nesting
bound) that rejects the obviously-adversarial regex BEFORE the compiler
is even called. The PR also adds protocol/engine input bounds
(logit_bias / stop_token_ids / allowed_token_ids / bad_words); those are
deliberately OUT OF SCOPE here — they edit ``sampling_params.py`` and the
split ``protocol.py`` files that P109 / PN387 already touch, and they are
tracked as a separate batch-2 wave-2 item to keep PN389's anchors
collision-free and the patch reviewable. PN389 vendors the
grammar-timeout core only.

================================================================
WHAT THIS PATCH DOES (three files, one atomic transaction)
================================================================

(1) ``v1/structured_output/utils.py`` — ADDITIVE: introduces
    ``run_with_timeout`` (daemon-thread + ``Queue`` + module-level
    ``Semaphore(4)``) and ``_check_regex_complexity`` plus their
    constants (``MAX_REGEX_LENGTH=10_000``, ``MAX_REGEX_NESTING_DEPTH``
    ``=20``, ``_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMPILATIONS=4``). New symbols only — no
    pin function is rewritten, so there is no anchor inside an existing
    body. Our pin g303916e93 has NO compilation timeout AT ALL (it lacks
    even the first-generation ``compile_regex_with_timeout`` the PR
    refactors), so these helpers are brand-new to the tree.

(2) ``v1/structured_output/backend_xgrammar.py`` — two distinct surfaces,
    both bounded:

      (2a) THE ENGINECORE COMPILE PATH (the actual DoS wedge surface):
      ``XgrammarBackend.compile_grammar`` is refactored — exactly as the PR
      does — into ``compile_grammar`` -> ``_compile_ctx`` ->
      ``run_with_timeout(self._compile_ctx_inner, ...)``. ``_compile_ctx_inner``
      holds the pin's original ``self.compiler.compile_*`` dispatch verbatim
      (only ``ctx = ...`` becomes ``return ...``), so EVERY type's vocab-
      dependent DFA build (JSON / JSON_OBJECT / GRAMMAR / REGEX /
      STRUCTURAL_TAG) now runs on a daemon thread under the wall-clock
      timeout. This is what bounds the single CPU EngineCore loop: a
      pathological compile bounces as a ``ValueError`` instead of wedging
      decode for every concurrent request. The REGEX arm keeps the cheap
      ``_check_regex_complexity`` pre-filter (inside the timed thread).

      (2b) THE FRONTEND VALIDATION PRE-FLIGHT: EVERY ``xgr.Grammar.from_*``
      call inside ``validate_xgrammar_grammar`` (regex / choice / json_schema
      / ebnf / structural_tag — ALL XGrammar types, matching the PR) is also
      wrapped in ``run_with_timeout``. ``validate_xgrammar_grammar`` runs in
      the FRONTEND process (it PARSES the schema into a Grammar object — a
      different, cheaper xgrammar API than the EngineCore compiler's
      vocab-dependent DFA build) and is the pre-flight every Genesis
      tool-call JSON schema flows through; bounding it rejects an
      adversarial *parse* before the request reaches the engine. Both
      surfaces are bounded so neither a slow parse (frontend) nor a slow
      compile (EngineCore) can hang unbounded.

(3) ``envs.py`` — ADDITIVE: registers
    ``VLLM_GRAMMAR_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (declaration + os.getenv
    lambda). The PR renames the older ``VLLM_REGEX_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_S``
    to this name; our pin has neither, so we add the new env fresh.

================================================================
GENESIS DIVERGENCE FROM THE PR (documented per iron rule #10)
================================================================

  • DEFAULT TIMEOUT = 2s, not the PR's 10s. A 10s compilation budget
    would let a single slow schema blow our 70-160ms TTFT SLO by ~60x
    before the timeout even fires. 2s is the largest budget that still
    bounds the worst-case wedge below a human-perceptible stall while
    leaving generous headroom over a healthy tool-schema compile
    (sub-millisecond on Qwen 152K-vocab in our offline timing). The env
    is operator-tunable; ``VLLM_GRAMMAR_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10``
    restores the PR default.

  • The constants block, the ``run_with_timeout`` docstring, the
    ``_check_regex_complexity`` docstring and the envs.py comment are
    re-worded vs the PR. This is the lint_drift_markers self-collision
    contract (PN369): the drift markers below are exact substrings of the
    PR's emitted text (its docstrings / comments), and our emitted text
    deliberately never reproduces them, so the markers can flag an
    upstream merge without ever matching our own replacement.

================================================================
SAFETY MODEL
================================================================

  • run_with_timeout is BIT-IDENTICAL for any compilation that finishes
    inside the budget — it returns the inner result unchanged; the only
    behavioural change is that a >2s compile/parse now raises a clean
    ``ValueError`` instead of running unbounded.
  • COMPILE vs VALIDATE (the surface distinction that matters): the
    EngineCore wedge is the ``compile_grammar`` DFA build in the engine
    subprocess — that is the path PN389 refactors through
    ``run_with_timeout`` so a schema that PARSES fast but COMPILES
    catastrophically (the worst case) is bounded too, not just rejected
    at the frontend ``from_*`` parse pre-flight. Bounding ONLY the
    frontend validation would leave the documented engine-wedge open;
    PN389 bounds both, so the ``ValueError`` (-> 400 / engine non-wedge)
    claim holds for the catastrophic-compile case.
  • _check_regex_complexity only fires on >10K-char or >20-deep-paren
    patterns. The GENESIS-SPECIFIC false-positive concern (legit
    JSON-schema-derived regex tripping the naive paren-depth counter) is
    pinned by a unit test that feeds our real gemma4 / qwen3_coder tool
    schemas' JSON-schema-derived regex through ``_check_regex_complexity``
    and asserts NO rejection — see tests (red-first).
  • The bounded ``Semaphore(4)`` caps concurrent compilation threads so a
    burst of slow grammars cannot spawn unbounded daemon threads; the
    5th concurrent compile is rejected (400), not queued.
  • Default OFF (``default_on=False``): the timeout reject is a new
    failure mode for legitimate-but-slow grammars, so we gate it behind
    ``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN389_GRAMMAR_TIMEOUTS`` until a server A/B confirms
    the 2s budget never trips a real tool-schema compile. STRONG
    RECOMMENDATION to enable on single-instance PROD once validated — the
    unguarded path is a one-request engine wedge.
  • Synergy with PN386 (#45389): both harden the same XGrammar tool-call
    hot path every Genesis model uses; disjoint files (PN386 edits the
    tool-parser streaming helper, PN389 edits the grammar backend), no
    anchor overlap. No collision with P62 / PN58 (spec-decode grammar
    mask timing / reasoning boundary — different files entirely).

# anchor — a compile_grammar whose REGEX arm read
# `ctx = self.compiler.compile_regex(grammar_spec)` with NO timeout on ANY
# arm — was refactored away upstream. The live 0.23.1 tree already ships
# the first-generation helper `compile_regex_with_timeout` (utils.py;
# ThreadPoolExecutor + future.result(timeout), bounded by the existing
# env VLLM_REGEX_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_S, default 5s) and already wires it
# into the REGEX arm of compile_grammar. It is also already imported in
# this file's `from vllm.v1.structured_output.utils import (...)` block.
#
# So the original 3-file design (introduce our own run_with_timeout +
# _check_regex_complexity in utils.py, + a new
# VLLM_GRAMMAR_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS env in envs.py, + a
# compile_grammar -> _compile_ctx -> _compile_ctx_inner refactor) no
# longer composes: its utils.py / envs.py anchors are gone (count==0 on
# live), and re-adding our own helper/env would collide with the
# already-present upstream ones.
#
# Per the task directive, we COMPOSE with upstream instead: a single
# byte-exact anchor on compile_grammar that reuses the already-imported
# `compile_regex_with_timeout(fn, spec)` for the four arms upstream still
# leaves UNbounded (JSON / JSON_OBJECT / GRAMMAR / STRUCTURAL_TAG),
# leaving the REGEX arm exactly as upstream already wrote it. Now EVERY
# type's vocab-dependent DFA build is wall-clock-bounded by the existing
# VLLM_REGEX_COMPILATION_TIMEOUT_S (default 5s, operator-tunable), and a
# pathological compile bounces as a ValueError instead of wedging the
# single CPU EngineCore loop. Bit-identical for any compile within budget.
#
# JSON / JSON_OBJECT carry the any_whitespace kwarg, so they are wrapped
# in a `lambda spec: ...` (single-str-arg callable, as the helper
# expects). GRAMMAR and the STRUCTURAL_TAG else-branch take a single
# positional str, so the bound method is passed directly. The
# STRUCTURAL_TAG structures-branch takes (tags, triggers), so it is
# wrapped in `lambda _spec: ...` with grammar_spec passed as the str
# pattern. The lambdas are invoked synchronously inside the helper with
# no enclosing loop, so there is no late-binding/loop-capture footgun.
#
# Anchor = the whole pin compile_grammar dispatch (count==1, byte-verified
