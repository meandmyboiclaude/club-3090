"""Consolidated wiring for P61b + P59 + PN51 — all three text-patch the SAME
engine file ``reasoning/qwen3_reasoning_parser.py`` at DISJOINT regions.

RETIRED 2026-07-03 (lifecycle: retired, capped <0.23.0): superseded by the
upstream streaming parser-engine refactor vllm#45413/#45588 (MERGED 2026-06-15),
which DELETED ``reasoning/qwen3_reasoning_parser.py`` — the engine-native
Qwen3Parser now owns embedded-tool-call recovery + partial-tag overlap on 0.23.x.
The target file is gone on the deployed pin (verified live dev714 2026-07-03) and
on the rollback pin dev672, so all three subs are inert across the ≤2-pin set.
Kept for reference / pins <0.23.0.

================================================================
WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (maintainability refactor, 2026-06-20)
================================================================

P61b (Qwen3 streaming partial-tag overlap guard, vllm#40783 slice), P59
(Qwen3 reasoning embedded tool_call recovery, vllm#39055) and PN51 (Qwen3
streaming ``enable_thinking=false`` content routing, vllm#40816/#40820)
historically lived in three separate wiring modules, each with its own
``TextPatcher`` and its own ``# [Genesis wiring marker: ...]`` line, even
though they patch the same file at non-overlapping anchors:

  - P61b → import of ``partial_tag_overlap`` + the streaming "still in
           reasoning" fallback emission. TWO sub-patches.
  - P59  → ``import re`` + the ``_EMBEDDED_TOOL_CALL_RE`` constant + the
           ``_split_embedded_tool_calls`` staticmethod + up to two
           ``</think>``-present wrap variants (C: P27-chain, D: pristine)
           + the truncated-output wrap. UP TO SIX sub-patches.
  - PN51 → the ``not self.thinking_enabled`` streaming short-circuit. ONE
           sub-patch.

This module collapses all three into ONE registry entry (id ``P61b``, the
reasoning primary) with ONE ``apply_module``. P61b is the primary because
P59 is enabled in ZERO builtin YAMLs while P61b is co-enabled everywhere
the coder primary P64 is; P59's and PN51's enable flags become
``env_flag_aliases`` on the merged entry so their existing YAML opt-ins
keep engaging the merged module.

================================================================
DESIGN: THREE SEPARATE TextPatchers, EACH WITH ITS OWN ORIGINAL MARKER
================================================================

Unlike the chunk_o (PN29+PN298) and rejection_sampler (P71+PN369)
precedents — which build ONE ``TextPatcher`` with all sub-patches and one
shared marker — this cluster MUST keep one ``TextPatcher`` PER absorbed
patch. Two engine-level facts force this:

  1. FAILURE ISOLATION. ``TextPatcher._apply_layer5_legacy`` returns
     SKIPPED for the WHOLE patcher on the FIRST ``required=True`` anchor
     miss (text_patch.py ~524). Merging all three into one patcher would
     mean a P61b anchor drift also skips P59's and PN51's sub-patches —
     a regression vs the three originals, where each failed in isolation.
     So each absorbed patch is its OWN patcher with its OWN ``apply()``.

  2. NO SHARED-MARKER CROSS-SHADOWING. ``TextPatcher.apply`` Layer 2
     (text_patch.py ~345) returns IDEMPOTENT the instant ``self.marker``
     is found in the file, BEFORE applying any sub-patch. If the three
     separate patchers shared ONE marker, patcher #1 would prepend it and
     patchers #2/#3 would see it and no-op their own anchors. So each
     patcher carries a DISTINCT marker — and we reuse each absorbed
     patch's ORIGINAL marker verbatim (re-exported below).

CONSEQUENCE FOR BYTE-EQUIVALENCE (marker carve-out — STRONGER than the
precedents): ``TextPatcher.apply`` prepends one
``# [Genesis wiring marker: <marker>]`` line per successful patcher
(text_patch.py ~435). Because we keep THREE distinct markers (one per
absorbed patch, verbatim), the merged module emits the SAME THREE marker
lines as running the three original modules separately. So on a <0.23.0
rollback pin where the file exists and the patches apply, the applied
output is byte-identical to P61b+P59+PN51 applied separately INCLUDING the
marker lines — not merely on the patched code regions. (The chunk_o /
p71_pn369 precedents accept an N-1 marker-line delta; this design has a
zero marker-line delta because it preserves the per-feature markers.)
Byte-equivalence is asserted for the patched CODE regions in any case; the
marker lines happen to coincide here too.

================================================================
PER-FEATURE GATING + VERSION-GATE REPLICATION (the critical correction)
================================================================

All three absorbed patches routed through the dispatcher's
``should_apply(...)`` and all three carry
``applies_to.vllm_version_range=(">=0.20.0", "<0.23.0")`` (the qwen3
reasoning+tool parser was restructured by #45413/#45588 in the dev148-era
engine, which owns embedded-tool-call recovery natively; these dev259-era
wraps would fight the native parser on 0.23.x).

``should_apply``'s version-only gate (``_check_version_gate``) fires
BEFORE the env-override branch (decision.py ~585 vs ~589) and is LIVE on
the rig (``GENESIS_ENFORCE_VERSION_RANGE=1``, composed from the a5000-2x
hardware yaml into both PROD configs). So a naive direct env check
(``is_enabled and not is_disabled``) inside this module would BYPASS the
version gate and APPLY the wraps on a >=0.23.0 pin where the file is still
present — corrupting the engine-native parser, the exact failure the cap
guards — while the standalone originals (routing through ``should_apply``)
would version-SKIP. The chunk_o precedent's DIRECT env check does NOT
transfer here: chunk_o's range INCLUDES the live pin, this cluster's
EXCLUDES it.

FIX (mirrors p71_pn369's ``_pn369_enabled()``): each per-group helper
replicates BOTH the env gate AND the version gate — it calls
``check_version_constraints({"vllm_version_range": (">=0.20.0","<0.23.0")})``
when ``_version_enforcement_on()``. The merged registry entry ALSO carries
``vllm_version_range=(">=0.20.0", "<0.23.0")`` (all three absorbed patches
share the identical range, so the entry-level range is correct and does
not over-gate), so ``should_apply("P61b")`` version-gate-SKIPs the whole
module on dev148 too.

================================================================
P59 REQUIRE-AT-LEAST-ONE — SCOPED TO THE P59 GROUP ONLY
================================================================

P59 is only functional when ONE of its core ``</think>``-present wrap
variants (C: P27-chain, D: pristine) actually landed; the injected helper
alone is dead code. The original P59 ``apply()`` enforced
require-at-least-one over ``_CORE_WRAP_SUB_NAMES`` and reported "failed"
otherwise. That gate is carried VERBATIM and scoped strictly to the P59
patcher's ``applied_sub_patches`` — it does NOT consider P61b's or PN51's
results. Likewise P59's ``no_applicable_sub_patches`` semantics stay local
to the P59 patcher.
