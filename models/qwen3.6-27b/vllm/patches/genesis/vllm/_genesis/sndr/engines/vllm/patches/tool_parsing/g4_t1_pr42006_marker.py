"""G4_T1 marker-only stub — apply contract for the registry.

The actual fix is the vendored parser file at one of:

  - ``g4_t1_v2_gemma4_tool_parser_pr42237_overlay.py`` (CURRENT, vendor
    of vllm PR #42237 — hermes-style accumulated-text rescan). This is
    the file the launcher binds into the container as of session
    2026-05-31. v2 dropped the third-party ``regex`` import that v1
    needed, but the marker pattern is preserved for clean separation
    between vendored code and the dispatcher apply contract.
  - ``g4_t1_gemma4_tool_parser_pr42006_overlay.py`` (LEGACY v1, vendor
    of vllm PR #42006 — segment-replay refactor). Kept on disk for
    git-blame + operator rollback path; not bind-mounted by default.
  - ``g4_t1_v3_gemma4_tool_parser_pr44844_overlay.py`` (v3 PREP, vendor
    of vllm PR #44844 — span-based rewrite + Genesis reset-guard
    hardening + the #44877 quoted-key hunk folded in). NOT bind-mounted
    anywhere; the A/B vs v2 on the 7x5 tool-call harness happens at the
    server stage before any mount switch.

Only the CURRENT (v2) file is bind-mounted by the operator's launcher
(NOT the Genesis dispatcher). The dispatcher cannot import these files
at boot because they reference engine-side modules only available
inside the container.

This marker module exists so:

  - ``test_patch_apply_contracts.TestApplyModule`` can import the
    apply_module path without pulling in the heavy parser
    dependencies.
  - The dispatcher's ``should_apply()`` and ``apply()`` lifecycle
    work uniformly for every registry row (the vendored overlay
    isn't a Genesis runtime patch — it's an operator-side bind-
    mount — so apply() returns "skipped" with a clear reason).

If the operator follows the launcher pattern documented in the
overlay file's header, the vendored parser takes effect via the
``-v`` docker mount. This marker is only the registry-side contract.
