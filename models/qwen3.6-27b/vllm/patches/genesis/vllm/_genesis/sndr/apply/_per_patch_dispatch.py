"""SNDR Core apply — per-patch dispatch functions (parking lot).

This module contains 95 `apply_patch_X` functions, each decorated with
@register_patch from `_state.py`. At module import time, the decorators
populate `_state.PATCH_REGISTRY`, after which `orchestrator.run()` can
iterate through them.

Status: PARKING LOT until Stage 6 reorg.

Each function in this file is a thin wrapper that:
  1. Calls `_wiring_text_patch(name, "patch_NN_descriptive_name")`,
     which imports the wiring module and invokes its `apply()` function.
  2. Returns a PatchResult.

At Stage 6 (reorg by engine subsystem), these functions migrate INTO
the per-patch subsystem modules (e.g. `patches/tool_parsing/p61c.py`).
This file shrinks to zero and is removed at Stage 12.

Migration history:
  - Original location: vllm/_genesis/patches/apply_all.py (Stage 0).
  - Stage 3 (CURRENT): extracted into apply/_per_patch_dispatch.py.
  - Stage 6 (PLANNED): functions migrate to per-subsystem modules.
  - Stage 12 (PLANNED): this file deleted.

#               RETIRED PATCH DECLARATIVE REGISTRY (T3.A + T3.B-PILOT)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# M.1.1.T3.A (2026-05-27) — scaffolding landed in commit f2886e4f.
# M.1.1.T3.B-PILOT-OF-1 (2026-05-27) — schema finalised + P8 migrated.
#
# Status & scope correction
# ─────────────────────────
# The M.1.R recon (``M1_DISPATCHER_TIER_MATRIX_R_2026-05-27_RU.md``)
# estimated "145 retired stubs" available for declarative collapse.
# Strict AST analysis during T3.B-PILOT found that 144 of those 145
# ``_skipped(...)``-bearing functions are **conditional-skip** patches
# (real ``try``/``if`` branching with ``_failed(...)`` paths, multiple
# return points), not pure retired stubs. Only **P8 KV hybrid reporting
# (per-token capacity)** matches the pure-retired-stub shape.
#
# Consequence:
#   - The promised "−2200 LOC" Tier-3 collapse is moot.
#   - Conditional-skip patches are not pilot-eligible and need a
#     different abstraction (or no abstraction at all). See
#     ``sndr_private/planning/audits/M1_T3_SCOPE_REVISION_2026-05-27_RU.md``
#     for the full forensic record + future-work pointers.
#
# This block stays as the canonical path for **truly retired** patches
# that may appear in future (e.g. when an upstream merge supersedes
# a Genesis backport). Each new retired patch flows through
# ``_RETIRED_PATCHES`` instead of growing another hand-written stub
# in ``_per_patch_dispatch.py``.
#
# Byte-identical position invariant
# ─────────────────────────────────
# ``_register_retired_patches()`` is called BEFORE the first
# hand-written ``@register_patch`` below. Entries in
# ``_RETIRED_PATCHES`` therefore occupy positions 0..K-1 of
# :data:`apply._state.PATCH_REGISTRY`. **P8 was historically at
# position 0** (the first hand-written decorator) so migrating P8 to
# position 0 of the declarative table preserves the snapshot. Future
# additions must respect this — if a retired patch needs to land at
# position N>0 in the boot order, do not migrate it without first
# moving the registration call site to the correct point in the file.

#   ``_RETIRED_PATCHES`` above. The original hand-written stub was a

#   apply_registry.json snapshot byte-identical post-migration.
#
#   Historical lifecycle rationale (preserved here for git blame):
#     Original purpose — closed the 3.76× KV-cache gap on
#     Qwen3.6-35B-A3B by excluding Mamba groups from the per-token
#     capacity divisor. Retired because vllm

    `num_accepted_tokens`, so P60's spec_decode_src_indices recovery never
    fires for the drafter's GDN attention.

    Fix: override GDN's `build_for_drafting` to read cached num_accepted from
    the builder's own buffer (set by the spec branch of the most recent
    main-step build) and pass it through to `build()`. Engages P60's recovery
    logic for the drafter forward path.

    """Patch 65 (Genesis-original): TurboQuant cudagraph downgrade for spec-decode.

    Root cause for noonghunna #40880 (MTP × TurboQuant × FULL cudagraph
    degenerate output) — identified by Genesis investigation 2026-04-25.

    `_prefill_attention` cudagraph capture bypass (and fast path) both pass
    `cu_seqlens_k = query_start_loc`, treating continuation prefill batches
    (q_len < seq_len) as first-chunk prefill. For MTP n=3 spec-verify batches
    (4-token uniform), the captured kernel attends ONLY to the 4 query tokens
    of current chunk, missing the entire ~290-token cached history. Drafter
    runs without context, predictions collapse to high-bias tokens.

    Workaround: downgrade TurboQuant `_cudagraph_support` from UNIFORM_BATCH
    to UNIFORM_SINGLE_TOKEN_DECODE so spec-verify K+1 batches fall to eager
    (correct per-request continuation branch). 1-token decode batches retain
    cudagraph capture.

    Cost: spec-verify batches lose cudagraph speedup. Net throughput should
    land between cudagraph=ON broken (85 TPS) and cudagraph=NONE correct
    (33 TPS). Correctness restored.

    NOT a proper fix — proper fix needs upstream rework of _prefill_attention
    bypass to handle TurboQuant cached KV under cudagraph capture.

    Mirrors closed/stale upstream PR vllm-project/vllm#23679 + addresses bug
    class identified in vllm-project/vllm#28015.

    When `uniform_decode_query_len > 1` (e.g., MTP n=3 → q_len=4), capture
    sizes NOT divisible by uniform_decode_query_len produce mixed-q_len
    batches at capture time (e.g., size=10 → [4, 4, 2]). The tail request
    with q_len=2 gets misclassified as PREFILL during capture, baking a
    PREFILL branch into the captured "uniform decode" graph. At runtime,
    real decode batches replay that wrong path → degenerate output OR
    illegal memory access.

    Filter: keep only capture sizes divisible by uniform_decode_query_len
    when spec-decode is active. For non-spec-decode setups: no change
    (filter is a no-op when uniform_q_len == 1).

    Benefits:
      - Boot 2-4x faster (fewer captures during warmup)
      - Less peak GPU memory during capture (avoids OOM)
      - No mixed-q_len batches → no prefill branches baked into uniform

    """Patch 67 (Genesis-original): proper-fix Triton kernel for multi-query
    TurboQuant attention against compressed cache for spec-decode K+1 batches.

    Replaces P65 workaround (cudagraph downgrade for spec-decode → ~30%
    throughput hit) with a Triton kernel that handles compressed KV cache
    DIRECTLY and supports FULL cudagraph capture.

    Reads TurboQuant k8v4 layout in-kernel:
      - FP8 K (e4b15 on Ampere/Ada, e4nv on Hopper+) via tl.float8 bitcast
      - 4-bit V indices unpacked via bit shift
      - FP16 scale + zero loaded as 2-byte pairs
      - Paged block_table lookup per KV position

    Online softmax per (q_token, head) pair. Phase 1 (prior cached, no causal),
    Phase 2 (current chunk K+1, causal mask `q_pos >= k_pos`).

    Cross-arch: pure tl.dot fp16, no FA3/Hopper-specific intrinsics.
    Tested on Ampere SM 8.6 (A5000), should work on SM ≥ 7.5.

    Empirical correctness (Phase 1 + 2 prototype p67_dev/):
      Reference vs kernel: rel_avg ~1% (FP8 + 4-bit quant noise normal)

    Status: opt-in via GENESIS_ENABLE_P67_TQ_MULTI_QUERY_KERNEL=1.
    On any error, falls through to upstream eager continuation branch.

    Once empirically validated end-to-end on Sander's prod rig:
      - Restore P65 to UNIFORM_BATCH (no longer need cudagraph downgrade)
      - Spec-decode batches regain FULL cudagraph speedup
      - Net: P64 + P65v2 + P66 + P67 = correct + fast

    output dim pad-on-load.

    The Marlin GPTQ/AutoRound kernel requires per-rank out_features to
    be a multiple of GPTQ_MARLIN_MIN_THREAD_N=64. When TP shards a
    weight whose natural out-dim is not tile-aligned (e.g. Qwen3.5
    GatedDeltaNet.in_proj_ba with num_v_heads=64 at TP>=2, or Intel
    Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-int4-AutoRound n=32 shard at TP=2),
    `can_implement` returns False and load fails / falls back to a
    much slower kernel.

    P87 wraps three MarlinLinearKernel methods via class-rebind:
      - can_implement: validates against round_up(n, 64)
      - process_weights_after_loading: zero-pads qweight/scales/qzeros/
        bias along output dim BEFORE the original PWA runs, so all
        downstream repack/permute/zero-point transforms see the padded
        shape consistently
      - apply_weights: pads bias if caller-supplied at orig_n, calls
        the original wrapped method (which now sees padded out-dim
        through c.partition_weight_shape[1]), and slices the extra
        padded columns off the output

    The padded weight columns decode to zero, so marlin_gemm produces
    zero contribution for them — the slice discards both before they
    reach the caller. Runtime cost is zero (padding happens once at
    load). VRAM cost is a few KB per affected layer.

    """Patch 58: ROOT-CAUSE fix for vllm-project/vllm#40831 / #40807 / #40756 /
    #37159 — backport of upstream PR vllm#40768 (z1ying, OPEN at time of
    writing).

    Async scheduler shipped `[-1] * num_spec_tokens` as a shared list reference
    every step; worker-side `_prepare_input_ids` overwrite path skips for
    newly-scheduled requests (`prev_positions[i] < 0`) → -1s reach GPU
    embedding lookup → either crash (V100 IMA #37159 / #40756) or garbage
    propagation as degenerate token loop (#40831 / #40807).

    The fix: track placeholder *intent* as a counter on Request, materialize
    `[-1, ...]` only when `request_id in prev_step_scheduled_req_ids` so
    worker-side overwrite is guaranteed to land.

    Touches three files in vllm v1 (request.py + async_scheduler.py +
    scheduler.py). Idempotent + anchor-safe + auto-no-op once #40768 lands
    upstream.

    Status: opt-in via GENESIS_ENABLE_P58_ASYNC_PLACEHOLDER_FIX=1. Independent
    of TurboQuant — bug class affects ALL spec-decode workloads under async
    scheduling. P56 (deprecated routing-layer workaround) and P57 v2
    (buffer-shape workaround) become redundant once P58 closes the actual
    root cause.
