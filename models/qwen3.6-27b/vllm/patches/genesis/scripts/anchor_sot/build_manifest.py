"""Phase 4 step 3 — classify + write the per-pin anchor manifest (host-runnable).

Reads the discovery targets (from the running container) + the pristine source
(from a bare image), classifies every anchor against the REAL pristine source
(R2), round-trip-verifies the ok set (R3), and writes
``sndr/engines/vllm/pins/<pin>/anchors.json`` (engine schema, validated) +
``drift.rej.json``. Needs sndr on the path; does NOT need vLLM (targets are
passed in), so it runs on the host where the manifest is committed.

Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 round-trip failure · 3 schema invalid.

Usage: build_manifest.py <targets.json> <pristine.json> <repo_root> <vllm_pin> [genesis_pin]
