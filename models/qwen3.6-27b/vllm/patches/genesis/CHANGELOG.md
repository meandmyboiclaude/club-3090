# Changelog

All notable changes to **Genesis vLLM Patches** are tracked here.

This is the public-facing release log. The exhaustive engineering log
(per-commit, per-patch decisions, per-A/B numbers) lives in
[`vllm/_genesis/CHANGELOG.md`](vllm/_genesis/CHANGELOG.md) — 2300+ lines.

The project uses [Semantic-ish Versioning](https://semver.org/) keyed
to internal sprints (`v7.62.x` etc). Until a 1.0 cut, expect
breaking changes only when an upstream vLLM PR replaces a Genesis
patch and the patch retires accordingly — those are flagged
loud-and-clear in the per-release notes.

### sndr-v12-import — two-lane apply: sndr_core_engine v12 vendored (2026-07-13, branch `sndr-v12-import`)

**Wholesale import of Sander's sndr v12 engine-patch surface (209 net-new
registry entries incl. the Gemma4 G4_* series, one-file-per-patch layout,
pins/anchor tooling) as an opt-in second apply lane.** Full decision record,
collision map, dev1060 anchor-manifest results and no-regression proof:
[`IMPORT-NOTES.md`](IMPORT-NOTES.md).

- Vendored byte-identical under `vllm/_genesis/sndr/` (compose mounts only
  `vllm/_genesis`; contract unchanged). Bridge: `patches/sndr_lane.py`,
  invoked from `apply_all.main()` after the existing lane; kill-switch
  `GENESIS_SNDR_LANE=0`.
- Policy overlay (in-memory, boot-time): 120 shared ids suppressed in lane-2
  (lane-1 owns them), 28 net-new `default_on=True` entries forced off,
  S-prefix flag aliases for the nine house-series PN-number collisions.
  `SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS=1` forced (legacy loop bypasses gating).
- `pins/0.23.1_9e57de719/` generated with his anchor-SoT pipeline:
  118 ok / 94 rejected (46 retired-as-expected, 10 genuine drift → 5 net-new
  BLOCKED-documented, 3 covered by our dev1060 re-anchors), roundtrip 0 fail.
- Verified in throwaway containers (CPU + GPU + wave-1 cudagraph flags):
  lane-1 applied set byte-diff-identical to the pre-import baseline
  (31 APPLY / 0 failed); lane-2 0 applied with live flags; the 8-patch
  full-cudagraph cluster applies under its wave-1 flags (PN522 additionally
  needs PN521's enable).

### v7.72.2 — PN70 tool schema subset filter + Proxmox VE installer caveat (2026-05-05 12:30 EEST)

**Two complementary improvements landed together: a Genesis-original patch that closes the third (and most general) fix path from [noonghunna/club-3090#57](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/57), and an installer-side caveat for [club-3090#49](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/49).**

**PN70 — Tool schema subset filter** (`GENESIS_ENABLE_PN70_TOOL_SCHEMA_FILTER=1`):

- Companion to v7.72.1's option-1 P68 fix (which **skips** the upgrade on dirty catalogs). PN70 implements lexhoefsloot's option-3: keep the upgrade, **filter** dirty tools out of the combined `anyOf` xgrammar schema.
- Wraps `vllm.tool_parsers.utils._get_json_schema_from_tools` and pre-filters tools whose JSON Schema contains xgrammar-unsupported keys before the combined schema is built and handed to xgrammar. Reuses P68's `_scan_schema_for_unsupported_key` so the unsupported-key set is single-sourced (no drift between option-1 and option-3 paths).
- Behavior matrix:
  - **all tools clean** → wrapper passes through unchanged
  - **subset compat** → wrapper builds schema from compat subset only; logs a WARN naming the filtered-out tools
  - **all tools incompat** → returns `None` (no enforcement, parser handles tool calls at output)
  - **any unexpected exception during filter** → falls back to original (defensive — PN70 never breaks a request that would have succeeded under stock)
- Composability with P68 declared via new `composes_with: ["P68"]` registry field. Recommended combo: P68 ON + PN70 ON → P68 upgrades `tool_choice` on long prompts, PN70 keeps grammar enforcement on the compat subset.
- Tests: +28 TDD (`test_pn70_tool_schema_subset_filter.py`) covering the compat helper, name extractor, env-flag matrix (5 truthy variants), filter behavior (clean / mixed / all-incompat / empty), defensive fallback, dispatcher registration, P68 composability regression. Schema validator extended to accept `composes_with` field. PATCHES.md sync gate updated (header 125 → 126).
- Full local suite: **1958 pass + 73 skipped + 0 failures** (was 1930).

**install.sh — Proxmox VE caveat + `--bare-metal` flag** ([club-3090#49](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/49) lexhoefsloot):

- New `detect_proxmox_runtime()` step runs after vLLM detection. Checks `uname -r` for `pve`/`proxmox` substring AND `/etc/pve` directory presence.
- On detection: WARN with link to club-3090#49 explaining the upstream `vllm/vllm-openai:nightly` × PVE 8.x kernel 6.17.x uvloop crash that was empirically isolated to the docker image (bare `docker run` reproduces, native venv on the same host runs clean). Auto-enables `--bare-metal`.
- New `--bare-metal` flag (or `GENESIS_BARE_METAL=1`) tells `print_next_steps()` to point operator at native `pip install vllm==0.20.x` + `vllm serve` instead of docker-compose presets. Auto-enabled on PVE; manually settable for any operator running microk8s / podman / k8s / bare-metal.

**Wiring + dispatcher hygiene:**

- New patch file: `vllm/_genesis/wiring/structured_output/patch_N70_tool_schema_subset_filter.py`
- New apply_all entry: `apply_patch_N70_tool_schema_subset_filter` (placed before PN65 access log)
- Dispatcher PATCH_REGISTRY entry: `PN70` with `composes_with: ["P68"]`
- Schema validator: `composes_with` added to `_KNOWN_FIELDS`
- PATCHES.md: PN70 row added to "Structured-output / Qwen3 parser" category, header count bumped 125 → 126
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md: `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN70_TOOL_SCHEMA_FILTER` documented under structured-output section
- Tests badge bumped 1930 → 1958

### v7.72.1 — P68 xgrammar-incompat tool skip (2026-05-05 11:30 EEST)

**Bug fix from cross-rig report — [noonghunna/club-3090#57](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/57) (lexhoefsloot).**

- **P68** (`GENESIS_ENABLE_P68_AUTO_FORCE_TOOL=1`) silently turned the upstream xgrammar `patternProperties` / `propertyNames` / `$ref` / `oneOf` limitation into a 100% reproducible **400 `ValueError: features not supported by xgrammar`** on long-prompt requests from agentic IDE clients (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cline, Cursor) whose tool catalog included even one schema with such keys.
- **Root cause:** P68 upgraded `tool_choice: "auto" → "required"`, which makes vLLM build a combined `anyOf` schema across ALL tools and run xgrammar compilation. A single tool with `patternProperties` (very common for `exec`-type tools) then poisoned every long-prompt request.
- **Fix:** new `_find_xgrammar_incompat_tool()` scans `request.tools` BEFORE upgrading `tool_choice`. If any tool contains an xgrammar-unsupported JSON Schema key, P68 skips the upgrade with a WARN, but P69 reminder still fires (only the upgrade is unsafe). Operators on a non-xgrammar backend (guidance / outlines / llguidance) can override via new `GENESIS_P68_FORCE=1`.
- **Tests:** +18 TDD (`test_club3090_57_p68_xgrammar_skip.py`) covering schema scanner + apply_hook integration + force override + P69 still-fires path. Full suite **1930 pass + 73 skipped + 0 failures** (was 1912).
- **Honest scope:** this is a workaround on the Genesis side, not an upstream xgrammar fix. The fundamental `patternProperties` support gap is tracked at upstream xgrammar; Genesis's job is to not weaponize it.

### v7.72 — `PN59-PN67` + audit hardening sprint (2026-05-05)

**7 new patches:**
- **PN59** (Genesis-original) — Streaming-GDN window-iterative driver (Variant D Phase 2). Empirically validated 2026-05-05 on 27B PROD: **−142 MiB/GPU at boot + −95% per-soak fragmentation drift**, 0 regressions. PROMOTED default-ON in 27B PROD.
- **PN60** (Genesis-original) — Quant arg validator (preflight DX, doctor extension); CLI `genesis preflight --quantization X --model /path`. Catches apnar club-3090#51 NVFP4 boot failure with one-line remediation hint instead of 30-line pydantic ValidationError.
- **PN61** (Genesis-original) — qwen3_vl loader KeyError → language_model_only auto-fallback (class-rebind wrapper). v2 with pre-emptive language_model_only set when NVFP4/compressed-tensors detected (avoids mid-load partial state).
- **PN62** (Genesis-original) — Text-only ViT scratch skip marker (3-5 GiB save target on qwen3_vl + NVFP4). Currently sets `_pn62_skip_vit_scratch` marker only — production hook deferred until NVFP4 cross-rig validation.
- **PN63** (Genesis-original) — gpu_profile advisory: prefer `--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e5m2` over `fp8_e4m3` on consumer Blackwell SM 12.0 (apnar empirical: e4m3+96K loses −2.6% TPS vs e5m2+48K on RTX 5090).
- **PN64** (Genesis-original) — Marlin MoE SM 12.0 placeholder entry (env-gated; awaits real 5090 sweep).
- **PN65** (Genesis-original) — Genesis structured API access log middleware. Replaces uvicorn's bare `INFO: 192.168.1.10 - "GET /v1/models" 401` with `[Genesis-API] 401 GET /v1/models <1ms client=192.168.1.10`. v2 fix uses persistent `logging.Filter` to suppress uvicorn.access INFO records (live verified — single source request observability).
- **PN66** (vllm#41696 backport, panpan0000) — Multiturn `</think>` leak in DelegatingParser. Removes buggy `prompt_reasoning_checked` short-circuit that walked the FULL prompt for `</think>` and prematurely set `reasoning_ended=True` from a previous turn's `</think>`. Defensive backport for multi-turn DSML/Hermes/Qwen3 chat.
- **PN67** (vllm#41674 backport, JasonKeyiL) — thinking_token_budget inverted-bool single-token fix. Removes `not` from `or not thinking_budget_tracks_reqs` in `gpu_input_batch.py:894`. Defensive; NULL-impact on Genesis PROD.

**Critical infrastructure / audit fixes:**
- **P79d wired** (was orphan in v7.69) — registered in `PATCH_REGISTRY` + `apply_all`.
- **P51 + P102 registered** — were runtime-active but invisible to dispatcher.
- **`qwen3_6` model_class mapping** added in `model_detect.py` (forward-compat).
- **`conflicts_with` symmetry restored** — 4 missing back-links (P65↔[P56,P57,P67,P67b], PN58↔P62, P7↔P7b, P28↔PN32).
- **PN64 env-gate enforcement** — `(12, 0)` table lookups in `kernels/marlin_tuning.py` now respect `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN64`.
- **PN65 v2 uvicorn dedup** via `logging.Filter` (was setLevel which uvicorn re-overrode).
- **PN40 scheduler subpatch split** — separate markers prevent partial-apply lock-out.
- **PN59 unified bool parser** — accepts `"1","true","yes","y","on"` case-insensitive.
- **PN60 wired into `doctor.collect_report`** as `_section_preflight()`.
- **`gdn_composability.composes_with`** honored — explicit-compatible pairs no longer trigger site-overlap warnings.
- **`preflight_checks` `consecutive`** rewritten as state-machine (`current_streak` / `max_streak`).
- **`env_flag_guard` scan** extended to `GENESIS_DISABLE_*` prefix (was unreachable).
- **P37/P40/P5b/P7b env_flag alignment** — registry was wrong, code/scripts were right; aligned to short form.
- **4 wiring routings** via `result_to_wiring_status` (P82/P72/P85/P100) — was masking SKIPPED → "applied".
- **Status helper migration** — 30 wiring files still pending follow-up sprint.
- **MultiFilePatchTransaction** atomic dry-run — primitive exists, `count(anchor) == 1` check pending.
- **AppleDouble cleanup** on server (56 → 0) + `.gitignore` patterns + `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` in syncs.
- **Deprecated external probes** (`patch_tolist_cudagraph`, `patch_40074_iooo`) removed from 4 launch scripts (P78/PN14 supersede).
- **pytest config** — root `conftest.py` + `pytest.ini`; documented `python3 -m pytest` workaround.
- **A-19 audit test** — `test_a19_optional_sub_patches_marker_policy.py` forbids `required=False` sub-patches sharing TextPatcher marker (PN40-class regression gate).
- **A-15 pytest torch marker** — auto-skip via AST scan for module-level `import torch` on torch-free hosts.

**Operator UX:**
- **Structured boot summary** at end-of-boot — system info header + per-category counters + APPLIED grouped by category with vllm# PR cites + SKIPPED grouped by reason class. 78 unique patches → readable single block, replaces scattered per-patch INFO lines.
- **Three tfriedel-pattern ports** — `scripts/verify-full.sh` (7-stage smoke), `scripts/probe_max_ctx.sh` (auto-binary-search max ctx), `scripts/fetch_models.sh` (SHA-verified HF download).
- **Comprehensive bench** — `tests/bench/comprehensive_bench.py` (cold-warm latency / sustained TPS / tool-call clean / multi-turn stability / VRAM steady / long-context needle) with README-ready markdown output.
- **Bundled `qwen3.6-enhanced.jinja`** + `qwen3.5-enhanced.jinja` (Cheuk-Yiu Chan @allanchan339) at `assets/chat_templates/` with relationship-to-runtime-patches docs.
- **MoE tuning workflow** — `scripts/moe_lookup_helper.sh` (renamed from `tune_moe.sh` 2026-05-05 per G-POST-05; the script names + stages JSON, the autotune sweep is manual via `benchmark_moe.py --tune` per the script's NEXT STEPS block) + honest documentation in `vllm/_genesis/configs/moe_tuning/README.md` clarifying that bundled A5000 Triton config is unused on Ampere FP8 (vLLM uses Marlin kernel; PR #40129 closed). Per-arch backend selection table added; cross-rig contributions targeted at Ada/Hopper/Blackwell where Triton path IS active.

**Live PROD bench (2× A5000, full v7.72 stack):**
- **35B-A3B-FP8**: 192.9 tok/s (CV 4.19%), tool-call 10/10, multi-turn 10/10, VRAM 22687+21998 = 44685 MiB
- **27B-int4-AutoRound**: 95.6 tok/s (CV 4.04%), tool-call 10/10, multi-turn 10/10, VRAM 22753+22064 = 44817 MiB
- Long-context needle: 3/4 found (1K/51K/92K — 10K MISS reproducible LITM)

**Test coverage:** 1858 unit tests pass (+247 vs v7.68 1611 baseline) + 73 skipped.

**Pin:** stays on `0.20.2rc1.dev9+g01d4d1ad3`. Pin-bump to vLLM main HEAD `0c620d2e08` (+25 commits) prepared (verdict GREEN, P4 + PN52 supersede markers in registry) — awaits explicit operator action + nightly publish.



### v7.69 — `PN35` absorption from club-3090#32 (2026-05-03)

After RossNE99 + GuiPerPT reported borderline OOM on 24GB cards
(`docker-compose.dual.yml` 262K context on WSL2; `long-text.yml` on
v7.69 needing context lowered to 110K), surveyed noonghunna's
`models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/` directory. Found 1 new sidecar
worth absorbing into Genesis as a first-class patch:

- **PN35 — skip inputs_embeds buffer for text-only models** (default
  ON). Backport of vllm-project/vllm#35975 by **AjAnubolu** (UPSTREAM
  PR, OPEN since 2026-03-04). Skips the
  `(max_num_tokens, hidden_size)` GPU buffer + pinned CPU mirror
  allocation in BOTH `gpu_model_runner.py:713`
  (`self.inputs_embeds = self._make_buffer(...)`) AND
  `llm_base_proposer.py:205` spec-decode proposer
  (`self.inputs_embeds = torch.zeros(...)`).

  For Qwen3.6-27B at `max_num_tokens=4096`, hidden_size=8192:
  - ~64 MiB GPU + ~64 MiB pinned CPU per buffer
  - 2 sites total → **~128 MiB GPU + ~64 MiB CPU per worker freed**
  - Default ON: pure addition behind a guard
    (`if self.supports_mm_inputs or self.enable_prompt_embeds`),
    no regression possible for multimodal models

  **Particularly relevant on borderline-OOM configs:**
  - Single-24GB-GPU + long context + spec-decode (Cliff 2 fires at
    "tried to allocate 50 MiB, 24.5 MiB free" thresholds)
  - WSL2 setups (per club-3090#32 reports — Xwayland/WSL vGPU layer
    eats extra ~830 MiB-1 GiB overhead, pushing borderline configs
    over the cliff)
  - Composes naturally with P103 + PN32 v2 (Cliff 2 stack)

  Pattern credit: noonghunna club-3090 setup-time sidecar
  `patch_inputs_embeds_optional.py` (2026-05-02). Originally raised
  by club-3090#32 reporters (RossNE99, GuiPerPT). PN35 promotes the
  sidecar to a first-class Genesis text-patch so it survives the
  entrypoint `exec vllm serve` pattern (same survivability argument
  as P103 v7.69 self-install).

  Auto-retires when vllm#35975 merges upstream — drift markers
  include both Genesis-specific `[Genesis PN35 v7.69 inputs_embeds_optional]`
  AND the upstream `vllm#35975` reference, so post-merge state
  triggers SKIPPED cleanly.

  19 new TDD tests in `test_pN35_inputs_embeds_optional.py`. Sweep:
  1599 → 1618 / 0 fail.

  Total PATCH_REGISTRY entries: 100 → 101.

  **Other 6 patches in noonghunna's directory** were surveyed too —
  all already covered by Genesis after the v7.66/v7.68 absorption
  series:
  - `patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py` → absorbed into PN25 v7.68
    (import-time registration)
  - `patch_pn30_dst_shaped_temp_fix.py` → absorbed into PN30 v7.68
    (part3 dst-shaped temp)
  - `patch_workspace_lock_disable.py` → absorbed into PN34
  - `patch_tolist_cudagraph.py` → already shipped at
    `tools/external_probe/patch_tolist_cudagraph.py`
  - `patch_pr40798_workspace.py` → already shipped at
    `tools/external_probe/patch_pr40798_backport.py`
  - `README.md` → docs

  noonghunna's sidecar set is now down to ZERO uncovered patches in
  Genesis (all functionality available via PATCH_REGISTRY entries
  or external_probe).

### v7.69 — close club-3090#19 cross-rig findings (2026-05-02)

After v7.68 reached noonghunna's club-3090 1×3090 + 2×3090 rigs (commit
`18e65e3`), three distinct issues surfaced. All three root-caused and
fixed in v7.69. Tests: **1512 pass / 73 skip / 0 fail** (+18 new tests
covering the three fixes).

- **F1 — PN30 part3 drift-marker false-positive (CRITICAL).** Root
  cause: `part3` declared generic `upstream_drift_markers=["[Genesis
  PN30"]`. Because `part2` (separate `TextPatcher` in same `apply()`
  call) inserts the substring `[Genesis PN30 issue #17]` into the same
  file (`v1/worker/mamba_utils.py`), `part3`'s Layer 3 drift check
  matched part2's own insertion and skipped with `upstream_merged` →
  required-fail → vLLM aborts on first apply. Fix: tightened part3
  drift markers to `[Genesis PN30 v7.68 dst-shaped]` (specific to
  part3's own replacement comment). Re-runs unaffected because Layer 2
  (idempotency marker) fires before Layer 3. 2 new regression tests
  pin the fix.

- **F2 — P103 setattr lost on `exec vllm serve` (HIGH).** Root cause:
  P103 v7.62.20 was a pure-setattr monkey-patch. In noonghunna's
  entrypoint pattern (`python3 -m vllm._genesis.patches.apply_all &&
  exec vllm serve`), `apply_all` runs in the entrypoint shell process
  and does `setattr(chunk_mod, "chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd", wrapper)`.
  Then `exec vllm serve` REPLACES the process image — the setattr is
  gone. Workers spawn fresh, import the original
  `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd`, hit Cliff 2 OOM at chunk.py:71
  (`chunk_fwd_o(...)` after the inner h tensor was allocated).
  
  The "rebound at 0 caller sites" log noonghunna saw was a red herring
  — internal callers in chunk.py resolve via `chunk_mod.__dict__` (which
  we DID setattr), so 0 external aliases is normal. Log message rewritten.
  
  Fix: v7.69 introduces a **text-patch on `chunk.py` itself** that
  appends a self-install hook at end of file. The hook checks
  `GENESIS_ENABLE_P103=1` at module-import time and calls a new
  `_genesis_p103_install_at_import(globals())` helper. This wraps
  `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd` in the just-loaded module dict —
  surviving any startup mechanism (entrypoint exec, worker spawn,
  spawn-context multiprocessing). Legacy setattr step is preserved as
  defense-in-depth for the current process. 11 new tests cover the
  install helper, env gating, idempotency, missing deps soft-fail,
  text-patch anchor, and v7.69 ordering.

- **F3 — PN32 v1 chunked at wrong level (HIGH).** Root cause: PN32 v1
  patched `forward_cuda` outer and sliced `mixed_qkv/b/a` before
  calling `gdn_attention_core`. But inside `_forward_core`, the chunked
  call to `self.chunk_gated_delta_rule(...)` still received
  `attn_metadata.non_spec_query_start_loc` describing the FULL prompt
  (PN32 v1 didn't slice metadata). FLA kernel allocated h based on
  full T regardless of outer slice. Empirical evidence: PN32 v1 OOM'd
  EARLIER (30K) than baseline (50-60K) — chunking overhead with no
  inner allocation reduction.
  
  Fix: PN32 v2 (v7.69) **rewritten to patch `_forward_core` directly**.
  Wraps the prefill branch's `self.chunk_gated_delta_rule(...)` call
  with a chunk-aware loop:
  
  - Slices `query/key/value/g/beta` along T dim
  - Builds chunk-local `cu_seqlens=[0, chunk_len]` per chunk
  - Threads `initial_state` via prior chunk's `last_recurrent_state`
  - Concatenates outputs along T (dim=1)
  - Single-sequence prefill only — multi-seq bypasses to original
    (chunking across cu_seqlens boundaries needs inner state-cache
    surgery not exposed at this layer)
  
  PN32 v2 **composes with P103**: v2 chunks the OUTER FLA call, P103
  chunks INSIDE FLA's `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd`. Together they
  give full Cliff 2 coverage on single-24GB-GPU. 19 tests rewritten
  for v2 semantics (anchor, replacement, threading, single-seq
  detection, env gating, dependencies docstring).
  
  Recommended pairing for single-24GB-GPU Cliff 2:

  ```bash
  GENESIS_ENABLE_P103=1                              # required (closes inner h)
  GENESIS_ENABLE_PN32_GDN_CHUNKED_PREFILL=1          # closes outer FLA call buffer
  GENESIS_PN32_GDN_CHUNK_SIZE=8192                   # default
  GENESIS_PN32_GDN_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=16384             # default
  GENESIS_FLA_FWD_H_MAX_T=16384                      # P103 default
  ```

### Live-validation matrix (all 4 configs on 2× A5000, 2026-05-02)

| Config | Boot | TPS @ 256t | CV | Tool-call | Active patches |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 27B INT4 + TQ k8v4 + MTP K=3 (PROD) | OK | **104.0** | 0.5% | clean | PN33+PN25(v7.66)+45 others |
| 35B-A3B FP8 + MTP K=3 | OK | **183.7** | n/a (1 run) | clean | PN33+PN25+PN26b+PN8 |
| 35B-A3B DFlash | OK | **155.0** | n/a (1 run) | clean | PN33+PN22+PN23+PN24+PN8 |
| 27B INT4 + DFlash drafter K=5 | OK | **129.3** | n/a (1 run) | clean | PN33+PN22+PN23+PN24+PN12+PN17 |

`PN33` text-patch verified in live `gpu_model_runner.py` on all 4
configs (marker present + K-aware code `list(range(_genesis_pn33_K))`
in place). The **27B INT4 + DFlash drafter** result (129.3 TPS on
2× A5000) lines up with noonghunna's published 78 narr / 128 code TPS
on 2× 3090 — same drafter recipe, similar consumer Ampere → cross-rig
reproducibility confirmed.

### v7.68 — diagnose + fix what cross-rig validation surfaced (2026-05-02)

After v7.66 reached noonghunna's 1× 3090 + 2× 3090 rig, cross-rig
testing surfaced 3 distinct bug classes that 2× A5000 PROD didn't
reproduce. All 3 fixed in v7.68 + 1 new companion patch:

- **PN30 v7.68 — dst-shaped temp** (corrects v7.65 layout-corruption).
  v7.65 PN30 used `state[src_block_id, :, offset:].contiguous()` which
  produced a compact `dim×(state_len-offset)` buffer; raw memcpy into
  the destination block (strided by full `state_len`) packed source
  rows into wrong destination offsets, corrupting DS conv state row
  strides on every `offset>0` copy. Surfaced as TQ store CUDA assert
  several layers downstream — the user-visible symptom was at the wrong
  layer, not the root. Diagnosis credit: noonghunna + ChatGPT/Codex CLI
  cross-check (club-3090 commit `9af1a52`). Fix: 3-file text-patch
  with new part3 on `collect_mamba_copy_meta` building dst-shaped temp
  via `state[dest_block_id].clone()` + tail copy. Old part1 path now
  fail-closed RuntimeError. 12 TDD tests pass.

- **PN25 v7.68 — import-time registration** (eliminates v7.66 TP=1
  spawn fail). v7.66's `direct_register_custom_op` still failed on
  TP=1 spawn config because `Library("genesis", "FRAGMENT")` was
  constructed inside the Dynamo trace context →
  `instantiate_user_defined_class_object` crash. v7.68 text-patches
  `activation.py` to register at module-import time (BEFORE any trace),
  caches result as `_GENESIS_PN25_SILU_AND_MUL_OP` module global.
  `forward_native` body reads only the cached global — never registers.
  Same pattern preventively applied to **P7b** (`gdn_dual_stream_
  customop`) — same bug class would have hit on any TP=1 enable.
  Pattern credit: noonghunna's `patch_pn25_genesis_register_fix.py`
  (club-3090 commit `a62ad78`).

- **PN34 (NEW) — workspace lock runtime relaxation** (PN33 companion).
  PN33 fixed BOOT-time `_dummy_sampler_run` under-counting; runtime
  decode path on `turboquant_attn.py:1350:_decode_attention` still
  raised `WorkspaceManager._ensure_workspace_size` AssertionError on
  rare paths (continuation-prefill into long context, MTP K=3 + decode
  mid-stream). PN34 ports noonghunna's
  `patch_workspace_lock_disable.py` setup-time sidecar directly into
  Genesis: relaxes the strict assertion to one-shot WARN+grow-anyway.
  Default OFF (relaxes a strict-debug assertion); requires PN33.
  Retires when vllm#40706 (TQ scratch dedup + reserve worst-case at
  warmup) merges upstream.

- **P103 fix — `T` undefined in chunked_fwd loop** (latent since
  v7.62.20). `vllm/_genesis/wiring/hybrid/patch_103_fla_cliff2_chunked.py:197`
  used bare `T` in `for start in range(0, T, _MAX_T)` without defining
  it. Cliff 2 chunked path silent-crashed `NameError` on every trigger
  since ship date. PROD didn't surface because continuous batching
  keeps `q.shape[1] ≤ max_num_batched_tokens (4096)` — well under the
  `_MAX_T` threshold that gates the chunked branch. Fix: `T = q.shape[1]`
  immediately before the loop + dropped 2 unused locals. Caught by the
  Gemini static-analysis audit (see "Audit pass" below).

### v7.67 — REJECTED on live test (2026-05-02)

Tried `@torch.compiler.disable` decorator on `SiluAndMul.forward_native`
(SGLang pattern from `python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/triton_backend.py`).
Empirically failed on 27B + TQ k8v4 + MTP K=3 boot:

```
torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported: logging.Logger method not supported for
non-export cases
```

Stack showed Dynamo tracing INTO `forward_native` body despite the
decorator, hitting `log.info()` inside `acquire_silu_out`. Hypothesis:
`@torch.compiler.disable` on a `@staticmethod` accessed through vLLM's
`custom_op._forward_method` dispatcher does NOT propagate — the
dispatcher reaches the underlying function via `getattr` bypassing the
decorator's frame guard. SGLang's working
`@torch.compiler.disable` patterns are on module-level functions, not
`@staticmethod` on classes called via dispatchers — pattern doesn't
transfer. Reverted to v7.66.

### v7.66 — root-cause spec-decode warmup fix (default ON)

- **PN33 — spec-decode warmup K-aware sizing** (default ON, opt-out via
  `GENESIS_DISABLE_PN33_SPEC_DECODE_WARMUP_K=1`). Backport of
  vllm-project/vllm#37521 by `itailang` (OPEN at backport time)
  EXTENDED beyond its `use_eagle()` gate to cover MTP, ngram, and
  draft-model methods. The vanilla warmup uses dummy K=1 draft tokens
  regardless of real `num_speculative_tokens` — under-counting the
  rejection sampler footprint at profile time → causes BOTH (a)
  ampersandru's mid-stream OOM via `propose_draft_token_ids` and (b)
  the workspace lock AssertionError noonghunna hit on dev205 + MTP K=3
  single-card. Same root cause, two symptoms; PN33 fixes the root.
  12 TDD tests pass.

- **PN25 v7.66 — direct_register_custom_op refactor**. Switched
  `silu_and_mul_pooled` and `dual_linear_parallel` registration from
  `@torch.library.custom_op` to vLLM canonical
  `direct_register_custom_op` from `vllm/utils/torch_utils.py:899`.
  `Library("genesis", "FRAGMENT")` at module level. Same fork-safe
  `hasattr()` pre-check guard as v7.65. Schema introspection happens
  at module import (synchronous, before any Dynamo trace), eliminating
  the "infer_schema skipped frame" crash class entirely. Note: v7.68
  later replaced the wiring call site (registration moved to
  activation.py import time) — see PN25 v7.68 above.

- **PN32 — GDN chunked-prefill (Cliff 2 single-24GB-GPU OOM fix)**.
  Splits GDN forward_cuda core attention + post-projection into chunks
  of 8K (default) when `num_tokens > 16K` (default, both env-tunable).
  Closes >50K-token single-shot OOM on 1×3090/4090/5090. Conflicts
  with P28 (legacy persistent buffer pool) — operator picks one;
  documented in dispatcher entry + wiring docstring + new test
  `test_pn32_documents_p28_conflict`. Default OFF — cross-rig
  validation needed (our 2× A5000 PROD doesn't hit Cliff 2 threshold).

### Audit pass (2026-05-02) — Gemini + ChatGPT/Codex CLI

Two independent static-analysis audits ran across the genesis-vllm-patches
tree to catch latent issues that pytest + live-boot couldn't surface.
Both found real bugs the test suite missed.

| Audit | Tool | Findings | Real bugs | Fixed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | Google Gemini | 1 critical | 1 | ✓ commit `5743c03` |
| 2nd | ChatGPT/Codex CLI | 16 (G-001..G-016) | 9 | ✓ commits `82c64c1` + `6f9c5eb` |

**Latent bugs caught + fixed**:

- `model_detect.py:185` — undefined `base` in exception path. NameError
  was masked by dispatcher's `conservative apply` fallback → genuine
  model-incompat could have applied hybrid GDN patches to non-hybrid
  models silently. (Codex G-001)
- `patch_103_fla_cliff2_chunked.py:197` — undefined `T` in chunked-
  prefill loop. Cliff 2 chunked path silent-crashed `NameError` on
  every trigger since v7.62.20 ship. PROD didn't surface because
  continuous batching keeps `q.shape[1] ≤ max_num_batched_tokens
  (4096)` — under the `_MAX_T` threshold gating the chunked branch.
  (Gemini)
- `vllm/_genesis/__init__.py` — eagerly imported `prealloc` (which
  imports `torch`). Every torch-less CLI / pre-commit / static-analysis
  tool failed `ModuleNotFoundError` before reaching their entry point.
  Fixed via lazy `__getattr__` for `prealloc`. (Codex G-002)
- `ResponseCacheMiddleware` — two contract violations: (a)
  `float("abc")` on malformed temperature leaked ValueError to client
  as 500; (b) corrupt cached entry → connection hung because
  `_send_cached_response` returned without sending. Both fixed.
  (Codex G-003 + G-004)
- `apply_all.py` — community plugins were applied BEFORE the core
  patch loop despite the docstring saying "After core patches finish".
  Plugin authors relying on the contract found post-modification
  anchors absent. Reordered + added post-plugin
  `validate_registry()` re-run. (Codex G-006 + G-007)
- 7 env-var references in PATCHES.md / INSTALL.md didn't match
  `dispatcher.py` — operators copy-pasting got no-op env vars while
  their patch silently stayed disabled. All synced. (Codex G-008)

**Lint pass (Codex G-016)**:

- 195 ruff `F401`/`F841`/`RUF059` errors → 0 (`All checks passed!`)
- Unused imports + unused locals + unpacked tuple cleanup
- 154 auto-fixes via `--fix`, 41 via `--unsafe-fixes`, 1 manual

**Cleanup pass** also closed G-005 (streaming docs/code mismatch),
G-009 (PATCHES.md P72 row truncated), G-010 (rig-specific paths in
scripts — partially closed with env-var override + README rationale
for the 50+ deferred PROD launch scripts), G-011 (`bench_suffix_sweep`
`speed_runs` computed but unused → biased Pareto ranking), G-012
(Redis cache size off-by-N for stats keys), G-013 (PN16 broken doc
reference to gitignored `docs/_internal/`), G-014 (TextPatcher
Python-only marker — documented).

### v7.65 — repo hygiene + community issue closeouts

#### Community-reported bugs CLOSED

- **#16 PN25 worker-fork crash** (BLOCKING real IDE-agent users on TQ3+
  spawn configs). Pre-check `torch.ops.genesis.silu_and_mul_pooled`
  global C++ registry BEFORE `@custom_op` re-decoration in spawned
  workers — avoids `infer_schema`-under-Dynamo crash. Sister-fix
  applied to `gdn_dual_stream_customop.py` (P7b) preventively. Live
  verified on 27B PROD: HTTP 200 + 32 reasoning tokens + 90.18 TPS.
  Reporter: noonghunna (club-3090). 9 TDD tests pass.

- **#17 PN30 DS conv state + spec-decode AL>1** (50/50 LCB v6 crash on
  structured-CoT). Two-file text-patch: replaces `NotImplementedError`
  in `mamba_utils.py:get_conv_copy_spec` with `.contiguous()` copy +
  module-level temp-tensor list; adds stream sync + cleanup in
  `do_mamba_copy_block`. Cost ~10-50us per batch when path active.
  Default OFF (opt-in for affected workloads). 10 TDD tests pass.

- **#15 PN31 FA varlen persistent out** (sister patch to P38). Per-shape
  persistent `out` buffer for `_flash_attn_varlen` eliminates per-call
  malloc pressure inside FA C extension. Memory cost: ~16-64 MiB per
  shape × layer. NULL impact on 2×A5000 PROD; designed for 1×3090
  community users with budget-constrained workloads. Default OFF.
  9 TDD tests pass.

### Warnings cleanup (118 → 16, -87%)

- **P8 idempotent-skip log** clarified — distinguishes "already applied"
  (INFO) from real "anchor drift" (WARNING). Was alarming on every
  restart even when patch correctly applied.

- **PN9** (independent drafter attention) **self-retired** —
  `vllm#39930` merged upstream. Removed from all start scripts;
  use `--speculative-config.attention_backend` instead.

- **P67 hook ENTRY** misclassified `log.warning` → `log.info`. Was
  diagnostic for first-3 dispatches per layer, not actual warning;
  created ~50 fake-WARNING entries per boot.

- **Pip "running as root"** silenced via `--root-user-action=ignore`
  in all 7 start scripts.

- **`vllm serve --model X` deprecation** — changed to positional
  argument in all 7 start scripts.

### Infrastructure hardening

- **T4.6 Compile-time watchdog** — `PatchStats.compile_elapsed_sec`
  field + 3-tier threshold logging (>120s WARNING with recovery hint).
  Visibility into Triton autotune cache regression / cold-compile cost.

- **T4.5 Boot-time probe** — standalone CLI
  `python3 -m vllm._genesis.utils.boot_probe` for spec-decode cross-rank
  issues (#41190-class). Heuristic markers for `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`,
  workspace-lock AssertionError, OOM. Reasoning-mode aware.

### Added — new patches

- **PN21 — DFlash SWA partial backport** (`vllm#40898`, opt-in OFF).
  Two of three sub-files of jianc99's PR backported: `algos.py`
  (preserve `layer_types` / `use_sliding_window` / `sliding_window` /
  `max_window_layers` from speculators-format checkpoint into HF
  config) + `dflash.py` (force `causal=True` for sliding-window
  layer attention metadata). The `qwen3_dflash.py` model-class
  changes (7+ sub-patches across `Attention.__init__` / `DecoderLayer.__init__`
  / Model class) NOT backported — too fragile for text-patch.
  Empirical on 35B-A3B-FP8-DFlash 160K (3-run sweep):
  `5-6/7` tool-call with PN21 ON vs `7/7` baseline OFF.
  Without the model-side changes, config preserves SWA but the model
  still constructs full attention → metadata/compute mismatch shifts
  spec acceptance. **Default OFF, NOT enabled in any launch script**
  until upstream merges or full manual model-class backport.

- **PN25 — SiluAndMul.forward_native opaque-op pool** (Genesis-original,
  opt-in OFF). Sister-patch to PN12; complement, not replacement.
  PN12 patches `forward_cuda` (eager dispatch) but
  `custom_ops=["none"]` (V1 default for `aot_compile_fullgraph`)
  routes through `forward_native` which Inductor inlines and lowers
  to `empty_strided_cuda(...)` — completely bypassing PN12's pool.
  Reported by noonghunna in `club-3090#16` (VolandBerlioz Reddit + ampersandru
  cross-rig: RTX 3090 24 GB + Lorbus 27B + OpenCode 29K-token prefill
  OOMs at 137.6 MiB). PN25 registers `genesis::silu_and_mul_pooled`
  as `torch.library.custom_op` with `mutates_args=()` and
  `device_types=("cuda",)`. Inductor treats opaque ops as no-inline.
  Body acquires from `FFNIntermediateCache` pool (same one PN12
  uses) and dispatches to `torch.ops._C.silu_and_mul`.
  PN12 + PN25 patch DIFFERENT methods so anchors never collide;
  pool is shared singleton. Recommended pairing for any
  inductor-heavy config; standalone use covers single-path setups.

- **PN26 — TQ unified perf pack** (Genesis-original combining 3
  upstream OPEN PRs from jasonkim8652, opt-in OFF):
  - **Taken from #41418** (centroids prebake): pre-baked Lloyd-Max
    centroid tables for `(d=128, bits=4 / 8 / 3)` — covers our PROD
    presets `turboquant_4bit_nc` / `turboquant_k8v4` / `turboquant_3bit_nc`.
    Empirical on live container: `(128, 8)` `0.018ms` vs solver
    `4583.9ms` = **259,812× speedup** on cold boot.
  - **Genesis defensive addition** vs upstream: at first use, runs
    `prebaked == solver` self-check for `(128, 4)`. On drift > 1e-3
    (real Lloyd-Max algorithm change upstream), auto-disables
    prebake and falls through to runtime solver with a WARNING.
    On 1e-6 drift (round-noise from int/1e10 encoding), logs INFO
    and keeps prebake. Threshold gates against silent staleness.
  - **Taken from #41422 (scaffold-only)**: sparse V tile-skip kernel
    modification. Author validated AMD MI300X only; NVIDIA Ampere
    correctness needs empirical confirmation. Ships as scaffold
    gated by `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN26_SPARSE_V=1` sub-flag; actual
    kernel wiring deferred to next iteration.
  - **Dropped from #41414**: head_dim power-of-2 padding. Qwen3.6
    head_dim=128 is already pow-2; the patch would add a runtime
    branch that is dead code on our model.

- **PN27 — Revert MoERunnerInterface PluggableLayer** (`vllm#41440`
  backport, proactive scaffold, opt-in OFF). Reverts vllm#35178
  (commit `b55b2652`, merged 2026-04-30) which made
  `MoERunnerInterface` inherit from `PluggableLayer` for OOT support.
  Issue #41306 reports v0.20 MoE perf regression: Mixtral-8x7B
  TPOT +21%, TTFT +59%, throughput -19% (8× H200). bnellnm (vLLM core)
  confirmed `--moe-backend=triton` restores v0.19 perf.
  **Our pin `g7a1eb8ac2` was committed 2026-04-28 — 2 days BEFORE
  #35178 merged.** So we are accidentally pre-#35178 and NOT
  vulnerable. PN27 is a **proactive scaffold**: when we eventually
  pin-bump past `b55b2652` BEFORE upstream's #41440 (or equivalent)
  merges, all 3 sub-patches engage and revert to pre-regression
  behavior. On our current pin, all sub-patches SKIP cleanly.

### Added — infrastructure

- **Cliff 8 hardening** (`apply_all.py`) — new
  `PatchStats.partial_apply_warnings` property surfaces skipped
  patches whose reason indicates real anchor drift / ambiguous-anchor /
  required-anchor-missing — distinct from benign skips
  (opt-in OFF, upstream-merged, platform mismatch, deferred,
  redundant). Boot summary line now appends
  `N ⚠️  partial-apply warning(s)` when count is non-zero, plus
  per-warning WARNING-level lines that name each patch + reason.
  Promised to noonghunna in `club-3090` discussion #19. First
  detection in PROD: PN9 self-retire on 27B PROD boot
  (`'spec_cfg.attention_backend' present in llm_base_proposer.py`)
  — manually verified PR #39930 + DFlashProposer `use_non_causal=True`
  is full superset of our partial backport; self-retire correct.

### Changed

- **A2 — P68/P69 long-context threshold default 8000 → 50000 chars**
  (Issue #9). Old 8000-char default (~2K tokens) was too aggressive —
  triggered P68 force-tool-choice and P69 explicit-format-reminder on
  routine IDE-agent flows that are NOT genuinely long-context. New
  50000-char default (~12.5K tokens) keeps the behavior for genuine
  long histories. Code default updated; 6 active launch scripts
  updated to override `8000 → 50000` explicitly.

- **CLIFFS.md PN19 H100-only flag** (Cliff 1 mech A section).
  noonghunna 2026-05-01 confirmed PN19 costs ~120 MiB KV pool on a
  24 GB single-3090 (vs documented 200-500 MiB win on H100). Disable
  PN19 on 24 GB consumer cards (3090, 4090, A5000) running long
  context. Same lesson as P104 L2 persistence — generic allocator
  hints don't survive GPU class boundaries.

### Verified (no regression)

- **#41190 stress test** — TP=2 + spec-decode + first-request
  `cudaErrorIllegalAddress` reported by their RTX 6000 Ada / AWQ /
  WIP-PR-#40898-build setup. Stress-tested on our 35B DFlash 160K
  (TP=2 + DFlash spec K=3): 5 concurrent + 30 sequential rapid-fire
  chat completions. **ZERO `cudaError`**, zero `illegal memory
  access`, zero `watchdog` events. Differences:
  they used QuantTrio AWQ (online-quant), we use FP8 (offline);
  their pin built off PR #40898 head (WIP), our pin on main.
  Possibly P58 (async scheduler placeholder) or P60 (GDN+ngram)
  defends against the codepath.

- **#41306 MoE regression** — verified via runtime probe that our
  installed `MoERunnerInterface.__bases__ == (<class 'abc.ABC'>,)`
  (no PluggableLayer inheritance). Our pin pre-dates #35178 by 2
  days; we are NOT vulnerable. PN27 scaffold ready when we pin-bump.

### PN26b sparse-V kernel — major iteration (v5, 2026-05-01)

Comprehensive deep-dive on Genesis-original sparse-V Triton kernel based
on 4-agent research synthesis (skip-rate observability + per-row vote +
memory profiling + 14-day community scan).

**v5 design** (lean dispatcher + tuning + observability):

- **Lean dispatcher** (no per-call GPU↔CPU sync; v1's `.item()` per call
  caused -16% short-ctx + -22% long-ctx regression — REJECTED).
- **Configurable launch params** baked at apply() time: BLOCK_KV (4/8/16),
  num_warps (1/2/4/8), num_stages.
- **`tl.range()` pipelining hint** (P67 v7.50 pattern, Triton compiler
  cp.async overlap with prior-iter MMA on Ampere).
- **Cache modifier `.cg`** on K/V dequant raw loads (L2 streaming).
- **Sink-token protection** (StreamingLLM finding — first 4 KV positions
  never skipped).
- **Skip-rate observability** (NEW): per-CTA atomic int64 counters,
  constexpr-DCE'd to zero overhead when disabled, `~50-100 ns` per CTA
  at epilogue when enabled. Periodic logging every 500 calls so
  operator sees real skip rate without cross-process IPC.
- **BLASST adaptive threshold scaffold** (`λ = scale_factor / ctx_len`)
  ready in code; default OFF until skip-rate data informs which mode
  is better.

**Empirical sweep on 35B FP8 PROD (TQ k8v4 + MTP K=3, 2× A5000 SM86)**:

| BLOCK_KV | num_warps | mean | max | CV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OFF (baseline) | — | 175.41 | 185.15 | 4.20% |
| 8 | 1 | 178.33 | 187.67 | 3.78% |
| 8 | 2 | 180.36 | 190.24 | 4.70% |
| 16 | 2 | 178.35 | 190.74 | 3.26% |
| 8 | 4 | 183.11 | 202.38 | 5.26% |
| 8 | 8 | 181.24 | 196.60 | 5.78% |
| **4** | **4** | **184.89** | 194.56 | 4.63% |
| 4 | 8 | 177.40 | 191.97 | 5.79% |

Winner: **BLOCK_KV=4, num_warps=4** (baked as kernel default).

**Final 35B PROD A/B (apples to apples, 100t output)**:

| Config              | tool-call | mean   | min   | max    | CV    |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Baseline (OFF)      | 7/7       | 175.41 | 158.71| 185.15 | 4.20% |
| **PN26b v5**        | **7/7**   | **182.30** | 153.53 | **212.24** | 7.02% |
| Δ                   | match     | **+3.9%** | -3.3% | **+14.7%** ⭐ | +2.82pp |

The `212 max` exceeds the historical 35B PROD ceiling reference (171-204
TPS quoted from earlier sessions). Tool-call quality preserved (7/7).
Sustained 50-request load: 0 errors, p50=181, p90=197, p99=211. VRAM
delta +142 MiB (acceptable, no leak).

**Caveat**: skip rate at threshold=0.005 is empirically very low on our
short-output workload (most TPS gain comes from kernel restructuring,
not the skip itself). Skip-rate counter scaffold ships so future
operators can data-drive their threshold tuning. Long-context (>16K
input) deeper sweep deferred to next session — needs sustained-context
workload to characterize properly.

> (server `192.168.1.10`, 2× RTX A5000) since 2026-04-29.

### Added

- **Genesis Compat Layer** (`vllm/_genesis/compat/`) — discovery and
  diagnostics package + 16-subcommand unified CLI:
  - `genesis doctor` — single-shot diagnostic (hardware + software +
    model + patches + lifecycle + dispatcher validator). Emits text
    or JSON.
  - `genesis init` — interactive first-run wizard (detect hardware →
    pick model → workload preference → generate launch script).
  - `genesis explain <patch>` — per-patch deep-dive
    (applies_to predicate, lifecycle state, upstream PR, recommendation).
  - `genesis list-models` / `genesis pull <key>` — curated 5-model
    registry; `pull` downloads the weights and writes a tailored
    launch script that engages the right Genesis patches for the
    hardware × quant combination.
  - `genesis lifecycle-audit` — CI-ready check that every entry in
    `PATCH_REGISTRY` has a known lifecycle state (exit 1 on
    `experimentl` / `retried` typos).
  - `genesis validate-schema` — shape-validates `PATCH_REGISTRY`
    (env-flag prefix, required fields, `applies_to` predicate
    well-formedness, dependency graph).
  - `genesis categories` — browse patches by category.
  - `genesis migrate <vllm-clone> --out runbook.md` — pin-bump
    runbook generator: scans your upstream vLLM checkout, flags every
    Genesis text-anchor that drifted, suggests retirement candidates.
  - `genesis recipe save / load / share / diff / adopt` — capture
    launch configurations, share them by URL, A/B them.
  - `genesis plugins` — community plugin entry-points
    (`GENESIS_ALLOW_PLUGINS=1` opt-in; HTTPS-validated).
  - `genesis telemetry` — opt-in anonymized stats; default OFF.
  - `genesis update-channel status / check / set` — apt-style
    stable / beta / dev channels.
  - `genesis self-test` — operator-facing structural sanity check
    (post-`git pull` / pin-bump). Same gate CI runs.
  - `genesis bench` — wraps the full benchmark suite under a unified
    entry point.
- **`applies_to` predicate DSL** with AND / OR / NOT trees, version-
  range matching for vllm / torch / cuda / triton / driver / compute
  capability. Backwards-compatible with all 50 existing flat-dict
  registry entries.
- **Patch lifecycle state machine** — `experimental` / `stable` /
  `deprecated` / `research` / `community` / `retired`. Code removal
  blocked until lifecycle state is `retired`.
- **A3/D2 dispatcher validator** — boots fail loud on
  `requires_patches` / `conflicts_with` referencing unknown patch
  IDs. Caught two real PROD-config issues at first run.
- **Reference benchmark fingerprints** in
  `vllm/_genesis/compat/fingerprints/` — blessed numbers per
  hardware × model × patch-set; bench tool can compare a fresh
  run against a fingerprint.
- **D1 CI upstream drift watcher** — daily GitHub Actions cron
  diffs Genesis text-anchors against `vllm-project/vllm@main` and
  flags newly-merged PRs that allow Genesis self-retirement.
- **JSON-Schema for `PATCH_REGISTRY`** at `schemas/patch_registry.json`
  + `genesis validate-schema`.
- **Pre-commit hook** at `scripts/git/pre-commit` — runs schema +
  A3/D2 + lifecycle audit + self-test before every commit. Install
  via `bash scripts/git/install.sh`.
- **Genesis CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) — 492-test
  scoped CI gate on Python 3.10 + 3.12. The full session test
  surface is **1351 tests / 70 skipped / 0 failed** as of this
  release.
- **Canonical `__version__` constant** at
  `vllm/_genesis/__version__.py` with `__commit__` and `__channel__`.
- **`scripts/git/`** — pre-commit hook + installer.
- **`docs/upstream_refs/`** — historical upstream PR diff studies
  (moved out of the root `reference/` directory by Phase 2.2).

### Patches added

| Patch | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `PN14` | TQ decode IOOB safe_page_idx clamp (vllm#40074 backport) | opt-in, validated |
| `PN16` | Lazy-reasoner request hook (Genesis-original) | opt-in, validated |
| `PN17` | FA2 softmax_lse runtime clamp (Genesis Issue #11 fix) | opt-in, validated |
| `PN19` | Scoped `max_split_size_mb` during model load (vllm#41268 backport) | opt-in, validated |

### Patches retired / annotated

- `P5` auto-retire when JartX vllm#39931 merges (TurboQuant hybrid)
- `P82` drift markers for vllm#40819
- `P94` superseded-on-merge by vllm#41043
- `P98` deliberate inverse of merged vllm#40941 (still required on
  hybrid GDN + TQ k8v4 path; documented why)

### Repository structure

- **Phase 2.1 wiring reorg** — `vllm/_genesis/wiring/` regrouped
  into 9 category subdirectories
  (`spec_decode/`, `structured_output/`, `kv_cache/`, `kernels/`,
  `hybrid/`, `middleware/`, `perf_hotfix/`, `compile_safety/`,
  `legacy/`). Layout-agnostic resolution via `rglob` + computed
  dotted paths. No callsite churn.
- **Phase 2.2 root cleanup** — 29 → 21 root entries.
  `docker-compose.*.yml` × 7 moved to `compose/`,
  `validate_*.sh` × 2 moved to `scripts/`, upstream PR diff studies
  moved to `docs/upstream_refs/`. Doc cross-references updated
  (35+ replacements across README / INSTALL / QUICKSTART / MODELS /
  BENCHMARK_GUIDE).

### Bench upgrades (Genesis Benchmark Suite v2)

`tools/genesis_bench_suite.py` now produces a single rich JSON per
run with the following sections:

- `engine` — vLLM version, system fingerprint, Genesis self-test
  summary, applied patches list.
- `tool_call` — 8-case quality matrix (4 cities × 2 thinking modes;
  positive vs. negative cases scored separately).
- `decode_bench` — N runs × M prompts × max_tokens; per-prompt
  detail + aggregate `wall_TPS`, `decode_TPOT_ms`, `TTFT_ms` with
  median, mean, stddev, CV.
- `multi_turn` — N-turn TTFT with conversation context growing
  per turn.
- `stress` — stability stress: SHA1 drift, NaN sentinel scan,
  repetition detection, TPOT trend, **`STABILITY_VERDICT`**.
- `output_length` — generation capacity probe at 1K..16K target
  lengths, with per-probe VRAM tracking (`vram_before_mib`,
  `vram_after_mib`, `vram_delta_per_gpu_mib`,
  `vram_delta_total_mib`, `verdict`).
- `accept_rate` — Prometheus `/metrics` scrape for spec-decode
  counters (returns gracefully when `--disable-log-stats` is set).
- `vllm_version` — parsed `system_fingerprint` (`vllm_version`,
  `tp`, `commit`).
- `genesis_state` — `--quiet --json` self-test invocation result.

Two new CLI flags:

- `--probe-output-length` — engages section 7 of the run.
- `--scheme http|https` — picks transport for `_build_url()`.
- `--arm-name <name>` — alias for `--name` (A/B compare ergonomics).
- `--compare a.json b.json --compare-out delta.json` — Welch
  t-test + per-percentile delta JSON.

### Docs

- New: `MODELS.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `INSTALL.md` (Docker + bare-metal),
  `CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`,
  `docs/SELF_TEST.md`, `docs/PLUGINS.md`, `docs/reference/` (operator
  reference per release), `docs/upstream_refs/` (upstream PR diff
  studies), `assets/README.md` (brand asset placement).
- Refactored: `README.md` cross-references updated for Phase 2.1 +
  Phase 2.2 layout.
- This file: `CHANGELOG.md` (root) — concise public release log.

### Tests

The exhaustive (out-of-CI) session test surface is now **1351 / 1391
collected (97% pass rate, 70 skip, 0 fail)**. The 121 drifted
out-of-CI tests rescued in commit `a3a8c8d` covered:

- `test_platform_matrix.py` — 66 tests rewritten for the new
  snapshot-at-load `guards.is_*` constants (no more `cache_clear()`
  calls — those functions are no longer `@functools.cache`).
- `test_v7_14_15_audit.py` — Python 3.13 dataclass introspection
  via `spec_from_file_location` now needs the module in
  `sys.modules` before `exec_module`. Added the bind.
- `test_p51_tq_active.py` — registry shape changed
  (`num_k_buffers` + `num_v_buffers` → unified `total_buffers`);
  logger renamed to `genesis.dequant_buffer`.
- `test_wiring_patch_8.py` — P8 `Issue #5` post-apply import probe
  caused over-defensive skip when `kv_cache_utils.py` returned
  `SKIPPED upstream_merged`. Now the scheduler.py sub-patch carves
  out that case explicitly (helper IS in the file → import will
  succeed).
- `test_p58_async_placeholder_fix.py` — single `SCHED_DRAFT_OLD`
  anchor was split into Site A / Site B in the 2026-04-28 P62-compat
  refactor. Test updated.
- `test_p59_qwen3_reasoning_tool_call_recovery.py` — `RETURN_THINK_OLD`
  similarly split into MONOLITH / MODULAR. Test updated.
- `test_wiring_runtime_rebind.py` — fake `TQAttentionImpl` was
  missing the `_init_turboquant_buffers` sentinel that the upstream-
  drift detector probes for. Added.
- `test_config_detect.py` / `test_model_detect.py` — guarded with
  `pytest.mark.skipif` when `vllm.config` not importable (CPU-only
  / no-vllm envs). Run normally in the integration container.
- Added an autouse `conftest.py` fixture that wipes the central
  `prealloc_budget._CACHED` before/after every test — prevents
  cross-test pollution.
